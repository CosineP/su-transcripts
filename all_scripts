**** Gem Glow ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way that's why the people of this world - # believe in # -
# Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x01 - Gem Glow
Noooooooo! This can't be happening! This has to be a dream! Lars! Lars! Please
tell me I'm dreaming! Get off me, man.
I'm stocking here.
I'm sorry, Steven.
I guess they stopped making them.
Stopped making them?! Why in the world would they stop making Cookie Cats?!
They're only the most scrumptious and delicious ice-cream sandwich ever made!
Don't they have laws for this?! Tough bits, man.
Nobody buys them anymore.
I guess they couldn't compete with Lion Lickers.
Not Lion Lickers! Nobody likes them! They don't even look like Lions! Kids
these days I'll tell you what! Well, if you miss your wimpy ice cream so much,
why don't you make some with your magic belly button? That's not how it works,
Lars.
Right? Oh, sweet Cookie Cats, with your crunchy cookie outside, your icy creamy
insides, you were too good for this world.
Uh Steven? Do you want to take the freezer with you? Hey guys, you won't
believe this! 'Sup, Steven? Awesome! What are these things? Ugh! Sorry, Steven.
We'll get these centipeetles out of your room.
We think they were trying to get into the temple.
Aw.
You don't have to get rid of them.
They're really cool.
Um, you guys? These things don't have gems.
That means there must be a mother somewhere nearby.
We should probably find it before anyone gets hurt.
Ooh! Ooh! Can I come?! Can I?! Can I?! Steven, until you learn to control the
powers in your gem, we'll take care of protecting humanity, okay? Aw, man.
Hey! Get out of there! Go on! Shoo! Shoo! Aw! They got into everything! Not
cool! No way.
I-It can't be! Wha Where did you get these?! I thought they stopped making
them! Well, we heard that, too, and since they're your favorite We went out and
stole a bunch.
I went back and paid for them.
The whole thing was my idea.
It was everyone's idea.
Not really.
All that matters is that Steven is happy.
Ahhhhh! He's a frozen treat with an all-new taste 'cause he came to this planet
from outer space a refugee of an interstellar war but now he's at your local
grocery store Cookie Cat he's a pet for your tummy Cookie Cat he's superduper
yummy Cookie Cat he left his family behind Cookie Ca-a-a-a-a-a-t now available
at Gergins off Route 109.
I can't believe you did this! I'm gonna save these forever right after I eat
this one.
Hello, old friend.
Mmm! Mmm! Ooh! So good! I like to eat the ears first.
Uh, Steven.
Wha? My gem! Quick! Try and summon your weapon! I don't know how.
Aah! It's fading! How do I make it come back?! Calm down, Steven.
Breathe.
Don't force it.
Yeah.
And try not to poop yourself, either.
Please don't.
Aw! I was really close that time! Can one of you just explain how to summon a
weapon? Oh! I'll go first Pay attention to these petals, Steven.
The petal's dance seems improvised, but it is being calculated in real time,
based on the physical properties of this planet.
With hard work and dedication, you can master the magical properties of your
gem and perform your own dance! Like so.
wah! Did Pearl tell you the petal thing? Yeah.
I need to practice really hard so I can dance like a tree I think.
Listen, Steven.
All that practice stuff is no fun.
Whenever I need to summon my weapon, it just happens.
See? Didn't try at all.
Again?! So, I'm supposed to work really hard and not try at - all at the same
time? - Yes.
Or you can link your mind with the energy of all existing matter, channeling
the collective power of the universe through your Gem, which results in at
least that's my way of doing it.
I think my best bet is to re-create what happened the last time my gem glowed.
So Garnet and Amethyst were here.
Pearl was next to the fridge.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Amethyst, I think your arms were crossed.
Okay, your majesty.
And, Pearl, your foot was like this.
I don't think it works this way, Steven.
And, Garnet uhuhyeah.
Then I took a bite of this Cookie Cat.
Oh! Wait! I sang the song first.
Uh, he's a frozen treat all new tasteinterstellar warand now available at
Gergins.
Aw! It was funnier last time! Maybe I'm not a real Crystal Gem.
Don't be silly, Steven.
Of course you are.
And you're fun to have around, even if your gem is useless.
I mean you're one of us, Steven.
We're not the Crystal Gems without you.
Yeah.
Even if I don't have powers, I've still got Cookie Cat! Mmm! So good! Steven,
it's a shield! Oh! What?! I get a shield?! Oh, yeah! Great.
Oh! Cookie Cat! I summon my weapon by eating ice cream! What's in these things?
What was that? It's the mother.
Hup! Hup! Stay in the house, Steven.
No way! I'm coming, too! we could really use Steven's shield right about now.
Hey! Leave them alone! Steven! No! Cookie Cat crystal-combo powers, activate!
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm.
Uh-Oh.
We need to save Steven! Can we save ourselves first? Goodbye, my friends.
Why isn't it working?! Steven! No.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! Cookie Cat, he's a pet for your tummy.
Cookie Cat, he's superduper yummy! Cookie Cat! He left his family behind!
Cookie Ca-a-a-a-a-a-t! Now available nowhere.
- Yes! - Gems.
Weapons.
Let's do it.
Farewell, sweet Cookie Cats.
I'll always remember the time we spent together.
Shh.
Hush now.
- Are you crying? - Only a little! Well, I guess your powers don't come from
ice cream.
Of course they don't come from ice cream.
Don't worry, Steven.
I'm sure someday you'll figure out how to activate your gem.
Yes.
In your own Steveny way.
I'm okay, guys.
I just I-I think I ate too many Cookie Cats.
1x02 - "Laser Light Cannon" Hey, Fryman! - Give me the bits! - Steven, we're
closed.
- Ohh, what? - Give him the bits.
The bits! The bits! The bits! The bits! - The bits! - Okay, okay.
Take it easy on the counter, will ya? Yes! I can give you actual fries, if you
want.
Just the bits, please.
Thanks.
Ahh, sunset my favorite time of day, when the sun goes down and the second sun
gets bigger and bigger in the sky.
Yeah, that big, hot second su Oh, no.
What is that doing here? What is it? Aah! My bits! - This is bad.
- Look at the size of it! I had no idea these things were so big! Garnet!
Pearl! We saw.
Some of us are trying to protect humanity.
- Where were you? - Eating fry bits.
Ugh.
Can I see? Whoa.
It's a giant eyeball! Awesome! Not awesome! It's a red eye! A red eye?! It's
going to infect us all! That's pinkeye, Steven.
It's going to crash into Beach City and crush us, along with a bunch of
oblivious, innocent people.
- We have to stop it.
- What are we going to do? The only thing powerful enough to destroy it is a
Light Cannon that belonged to Rose Quartz.
My Mom? If Rose were here, this would be so easy.
I know, but she's not, and the cannon is missing.
We'll have to find another solution.
If it belonged to my Mom, I bet my Dad knows where it is.
He can help us save the day! Huh? Eh? Greg is nice, Steven, but I doubt Rose
would entrust someone like him with such a powerful weapon.
Your dad is kind of a mess, Steven.
- Amethyst! - I'm just saying.
Even if she did leave it with him, he probably broke it or lost it or dropped
it in the ocean by now.
True.
No way! I'm sure he's just keeping it somewhere safe.
I'll go ask him.
We can handle this, Steven.
Ready? Uh, I'm gonna go.
Okay, good luck.
Dad, it's me! Dad? Are you in there? Wake up! We have to save the world! Dad!
Who's there?! I have a waffle iron! Dad, it's me! Steven? I almost waffled your
face! What are you doing up so late? What do you mean? The sun just went down
an hour ago.
It was a slow day at the car wash.
Anyway, what's up? Just needed to see your old man, pal around, learn some
lessons about life? No! I need the Light Cannon that belonged to Mom to blow up
that eyeball! - Eyeball? - That! Wait.
Is that a magical thing? The Gems told me not to get involved with magic stuff.
It it could be dangerous or interfere with what's left of my hair.
But they need Mom's cannon.
You've got to know where it is! Like a cave dungeon or a cloud fortress or in a
clam at the bottom of the ocean.
Well, I don't know about all that, but I have an idea where it might be.
A magical storage unit! Huh.
Not exactly.
But some would say there's magic inside.
It's just a shed I use to keep things that don't fit in the van.
If it's anywhere it'll be in here.
If I'm going in there, I'm gonna need some gear.
- Here I go! - Good luck.
Whoa! Cool! It's like a Dad museum! Huh? There it is! Whoa! Ugh! Do you golf?
Ah, I like to think of myself as someone who would golf eventually.
Hmm? Yes! A drum.
No.
No.
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Is this? "Buy T-shirt Cannons"? Hey,
there's a bunch of copies of your old CD! Huh.
Oh, man.
I couldn't give those things away.
You know, before I ran the car wash, when I was a one-man band, I traveled the
whole country.
I know, Dad.
When I came to play a concert here in Beach City, no one - showed up except -
An alligator! - No, it was your mother.
- I know.
And we were always together after that, until she gave up her physical form to
bring you into the world.
I don't know what a magic lady like her ever saw in a plain, old dope like me.
Uh, Dad? I broke a photo.
It's okay, buddy.
If every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs.
Huh? The Light Cannon! Oh, boy.
That thing's giving me the willies.
Dad, I found it! - Really? - Get the van! This thing could save the city! -
We've got to get it to the beach! - How? It's too big for the van.
Easy does it.
Is it gonna be okay? Mm.
If every pork chop were perfect We wouldn't have hot dogs! That thing's getting
huge.
It's freaking me out.
Can't the van go any faster? - This is faster! - Don't worry.
Come on.
Let's put on your CD.
What? Really? Uh, come on, you've heard it.
You come on.
# I know I'm not that tall # I know I'm not that smart, but Let me drive my van
into your heart let me drive my van into your heart I know I'm not that rich
I'm trying to get my start so, let me drive my van into your heart let me drive
my van into your heart and if we look out of place well, baby, that's okay I'll
drive us into outer space Throw me again.
I think I'm cracking it! - His dad? - Hey, guys! - He really had it.
- We're saved! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Easy! We have to use it now.
I don't know how it works! It was Rose's! - Dad, how do we use it? - Mm.
Steven, this is serious.
The Gem! - You have Rose's gem! - That's it! Ugh! Come on! - Stop that.
- It's no use.
Fine! Forget it! Throw me again! That's not going to work! Whoa! I got this.
No! Wait! No, maybe I don't! Please work.
Unlock.
Activate.
Go.
Please? Everyone's counting on you! You can't just be useless! - I know you can
help! - It's okay, Steven! We'll figure out something else, something even
better! R-right! If every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs.
It's working! Steven! - This is it! - Brace yourselves! Steven, you just saved
most of Beach City! Sorry about that! What?! How did you get it to work? I just
said that thing that Dad always says.
- That thing about pork rinds? - Hot dogs.
Rose.
- My van! - It's okay, Dad.
- If every pork chop were perfect - I live in there! - Wait up! Geez! - My
keys! - Whoa! - Wait! Wait! Oh, geez.

**** Cheeseburger Backpack ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way that's why the people of this world - # believe in # -
# Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x03 - "Cheeseburger
Backpack " Hey, Mr.
Postman, bring me a post bring me the post that I love the most Huh? My song
came true! Do you have a package for me today? Hold on.
Let me see what I've got here.
Did you order a loaf of bread with a stamp on it? - No.
- Did you order a jury summons - for R.
J.
Finkle? - That's not me - I'm Steven.
- Oh, right, right, right Steven.
Here it is Steven Universe.
Ha! This thing is gonna help me save the world! Really? It says it's from Wacky
Sacks supply company.
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl think I shouldn't go on magic adventures because I
don't - know how to use my gem powers.
- That seems reasonable.
But there are other ways I can help.
- With a Wacky Sack? - Exactly! You know how you can save my world? - Sign
here, please.
- Ah! Barb yells at me if I don't get signatures.
That's awful.
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl are back! W-wait! Steven! - What is a Wacky Sack? -
Huh? - Hello, Steven.
- Amethyst, we do not need that.
- It's not going to fit in the fridge.
- What? I got this.
Hup! Look it fits! Ha! Oh, man, we could make a big omelet or a quiche or big -
sunny-side-ups! - We fought a giant bird.
We can bake it That's a thing, right? We're only here for a second.
We've got to go back out.
- What? Why? - We have to place this Moon goddess statue on the top of the
lunar sea spire before midnight.
Without it, the whole place will fall apart! Oh, Steven, you should have seen
the spire in its heyday.
It was an oasis for gems on Earth.
It's abandoned now, but we can still save it with this statue.
Wha that's perfect! - What? Why? - Because I can help carry it for you in this!
Whooosh! Whhhhhmmm! Whhhhhsssw! - Pwing-pwing-pwing-pwing-pwing! - A hamburger?
It's a novelty backpack shaped like a cheeseburger! Aw, I blew it.
I was just gonna wear it one day, and you guys would be like, "Dang, Steven,
that's so cool!" but this is obviously important - gem business.
- Yes, so you should let - us take care of it.
- What? I'm a gem! But you've still got a lot to learn.
So let him come.
It'll be educational.
Hmm.
All right.
You can carry it in your hamburger.
Mm! Check this out everything's a pocket! Even the cheese is a pocket! I can
fit a lot more stuff in here.
Give me a minute.
I'll pack extra supplies.
- Kid, don't shake me! - Mr.
Queasy! Ohh, I got a medical condition.
You're definitely gonna come in handy.
- Ugh! - Steven, let's go! - Uh, coming! - Whoa, Steven, did you - bring your
whole room? - Back that thang up.
Let's warp.
Suck it in, Steven! Do you remember how to do this? Oh! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Keep your
head in.
Come on! Whoa! The sea spire! Ohh.
It wasn't like this a hundred years ago.
- I'm sensing structural instability.
- Oh, yeah, that's never good.
- Gah! Steven! - What? All right, hold on.
We're taking Steven back! My achin' stomach! - Oh, Mr.
Queasy! - Kid, you're killin' me.
Steven! This place is your heritage! I want you to stay and help, but you've
really got to take this Seriously.
Can you do that, Steven? - You got it, dude! - Yes.
Enough.
We have to move.
What's the holdup? We can clear this easily.
No.
The magic that sustains the whirlpool creates a vortex that will pull us below.
So we can't jump? - Oh, wait! - What are those for? They were for keeping warm,
but check it out.
- Whoa! - Steven! - Wait! - Whoa! Oh! He's getting sucked down! Steven!
Cheesebur-r-r-r-ger! Steven, way to go! Come on, guys! Hyup! Steven-style -
Don't ever do that again! - Sorry.
But it was pretty great.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is even worse than the outside.
Ugh! That's oh! Oh, this didn't used to be so oh, and the water damage this
pillar oh, and this had a head.
Oh, Steven, once the statue's in place, it'll restore all of this to its former
glory What was that goober? - Crystal shrimp.
- You guys, we got a problem.
It's an infestation! And we have to pass through - there to get to the top.
- Can't you just squish 'em? Don't touch that! Their shards are deadly! We need
to clear a path.
Amethyst, if you go around to the side and disturb them with a spin attack and,
Garnet, if you move to the ceiling and strike this exact spot - then I can
advance with my - Bagel sandwich! - Brilliant.
- Oh, hey.
What do you know? Uh, uh.
How did you know that would work? Well, if I were a shrimp, that's what I would
do.
- You are a shrimp.
- I just want everyone to know my plan would have also worked.
Watch out! - Whoa! - What are we gonna do? - What me? - What have you got?
Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! Pearl, come on.
- Ohh, all right.
- Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! A raft! - Whoa! - Ah! - Steven,
that's so sensible.
- Whoa! - Good idea, anyway, Steven.
- Yeah, they can't all be winners.
This is it the Moon goddess pedestal.
And the Moon is almost overhead! It's not too late to save this - piece of
history! - Steven, the statue.
Uh, I-I, uh Uh, uh, I - What's the holdup? - I don't have it.
What?! I must have left it on the bed! There's there's no time! Wait! I have an
idea! - Ugh! - Ah.
- Could that work? - Mm-mnh-mnh.
Ugh! Kid, don't shake me! Wh-o-o-o-o-o-oa! Whoa! Everyone, keep steady! Whoa!
Ohh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! This is all my fault.
I broke it! No, Steven, the spire was falling apart when we got here.
You handled everything well under pressure.
You did great.
Yeah, 2 out of 4 of your ideas worked that's 50%.
Yeah, I guess you're right they can't all be winners.
Whoo! Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! It's a three-hour paddle
home.
Anyone want a wet bagel? 1x04 - "Together Breakfast" Everyone's out.
Guess I'm making us breakfast.
Pearl! Garnet! Amethyst! Is anyone home? Hmm.
One, two, three warp in! Guess they're still out saving the world.
Look at you.
You are out of control.
Pearl! Garnet! It's done! That thing's too good for me to eat alone.
It's a together breakfast.
Ah, Garnet! Perfect.
Check it out.
It's not exactly healthy, but it's in a stack, so I guess you could say it's a
balanced breakfast.
You know, like, I made us all breakfast.
I thought we could eat together like - like best buds.
- I can't stay.
There's business to attend to inside the temple.
Aw, business? Like what? I have to burn this.
Cool! - Uh! - I have to burn this, too.
No! My apps! Door! Open door.
Aw, you never work when I need it.
Dumb police! Uh, you're dumb! Nooooooo! Oh, man.
I totally got you.
You should have seen - the look on your face.
- Oh, I knew it was you.
How? 'Cause that's a water gun, and I'm not dumb.
You got something on your shirt.
Duuuuh-umb.
Hey! That's my door.
Oh, Amethyst, there you are.
Care to explain what one of my - swords was doing in your room? - Having a
sword party.
- Oh, please! You took it.
- I did not! It's fine.
It's in the past.
I forgive you.
Also, I cleaned up your awful, awful mess.
- You're welcome.
- You did what?! - I have a system! - Amethyst! Wait! - What's the matter,
Steven? - I wanted us all to have breakfast together, so I made together
breakfast, - but everyone keeps leaving.
- Oh, that's nice.
Oh, no! Not you, too.
I can't let this become together brunch.
Wha? Hmm.
There we go.
Ahh! Hey, Pearl! Steven! What are you doing in here? You know it's dangerous
for you - inside the temple.
- We're gonna have a nice together breakfast even if I have to get my shoes
wet.
What?! - Get out of there! - I'll swim it over to you.
See? Doggy paddle, forward.
Oh, gosh.
Wait.
Uh, doggy paddle, reverse.
- Reverse! - Steven! What the? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Keep it together, breakfast! - Better.
- Amethyst! Oh, hey, Steven.
Did you come down the waterfall? Pearl gets so mad that I have her junk, but
it's always - falling down here.
- Junk like what? Junk like you! I'm gonna throw you in the junk pile.
Isn't it awful? - Pearl organized everything.
- It still looks messy to me.
Aw, thanks.
I try.
Boom! - Oh, what's that, Steven? - It's a together breakfast.
- All right! Snacks! - No! It's for everyone to eat together.
That's the essence of together breakfast.
Ahh.
Give me! Give me! We have to eat it together! Huh? Whoa! You can't outrun me!
We both have short legs.
- Huh? What?! - Steven! I'm hungry! Just hold on! An exit! Whoo! - Skills! -
Get back here.
You're completely missing the point of this.
Hey, wait a second.
Steven! There you are.
Pearl! Sweet! Two out of three.
- Oh, oh! Steven, be careful.
- Why? Wha? Whoa.
You really shouldn't be in here.
This is the crystal heart.
Oh! It's connected to the most dangerous areas of the temple.
Hold on tight - and don't look down.
- Huh? Oh! Oh, hey.
This isn't so bad.
Uh, never mind.
Whoa! Aw.
Steven, we're getting you out of here.
- Come on.
- Huh? This is great! We're all together! Huh? We can finally eat.
I mean, we don't have any forks, but we can use our hands.
I'm not gonna judge.
- Steven, go! - Okay.
Want to meet in the kitchen? Whoa! It's trying to escape.
Force it back.
Get back! Steven! Together breakfast? It's taken refuge in organic matter.
Now it has all the power of a breakfast.
- We have to destroy it.
- It's horrible! I didn't want this.
I just wanted to eat together like like best buds.
Steven, you've got to get away.
But my breakfast.
That's enough! I don't care if you are the most important meal of the day.
I made you to bring us together, not to tear us apart! I'm sorry, guys.
I guess I dreamed too big.
It looks great.
It's even more together and even more breakfast.
- I don't think I can eat this.
- Let's order a pizza.
- Pizza's a better idea.
- Yeah.
It's good.
- Definitely.
- It did try to kill us.

So, you're already halfway there.
Keep at it, Frybo.
- I'm Pete y.
- Hi, Petey! When I told my Dad I wanted to be part of the Fryman family

Things used to be different, Steven.
Nothing to worry about back then except making myself dizzy on the old seahorse
- ride at funland.
- Oh, Frybo, you're hilarious.
I wish there was a way for this costume to do its job without me in it.
Maybe it can, Petey.

No more shaking.
Put me down! Just go make people eat fries.
Ha ha ha! Let's go be kids! This seahorse used to make me so happy.
Now it's just giving me whiplash.
I feel like there's just no point to it.
- You know what I mean? - I-I-I just feel tingl-y-y-y-y-y! You'll understand
when you have a job.
I do have a job.
I protect humanity from magic - and monsters and stuff.
- I mean a real job that you - get paid for.

- I don't see anyone smiling.
You pick up a job to buy a house or raise kids or to impress your dad.
You work away your life, and - what does it get you? - Smiles and faces? No.
You get cash cash that can't buy back what the job takes Not if you rode every
seahorse in the world.

to do that! Did we tell him to do that?! Please! No more fries! Frybo, stop! -
I don't even like fries! - Why isn't he listening?! - I don't know! - Petey!
Where's all this coming from? Aw, I get it.
I pushed you too hard.
I thought you wanted to be as good a Fryman as you could be.
You're a tough kid for putting up with it as long as you did.
The truth is, you're a valued member of Fryman Brothers, Incorporated, and all
its affiliates! D-a-a-ad! No! He'll mash your potatoes! - What are you gonna
do?! - My job! Whoa! Ohh! Steven! Did you put my missing shard in that fry

**** Cat Fingers ****
We are the Crystal Gems, # we'll always save the day, # and if you think we
can't, we'll always find a way, that's why the people of this world believe in,
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven! 1x06 - "Cat Fingers" Almost done.
Steven, get the hubcaps.
Hubbin' it up! Hub it good.
This is a high-profile job.
You mean 'cause it's the Mayor's election-mobile? If we do this right, we might
get political favors.
I'm not sure what that is, but I like it.
Hey, hey, hey! I'm not paying for father-son bonding here.
- Universe! Control that kid! - Steven! I'm sorry, Mayor Dewey.
Uh, this one's on the house.
On the house, eh? I like the way you do business, Universe.
Mayor Dewey! Mayor Dewey! Political favors! Ah, you rascal.
Enough with the hose fights.
Ah, okay.
What the Whoa! What is with this cat? - Ha-ha! Got you guys.
- Amethyst! Uh, pretty cool, Amethyst.
Really cool.
I wish I could shapeshift like you.
You could probably learn.
Really? Sure.
You got a Gem.
Whoa! Magic stuff.
Should I get out of here? Is there gonna be an explosion? Ah, it's no big deal,
Dad.
Yeah, it's fuuuun.
Hey, Pearl.
- Do more! - Check it out.
- Whoa! - Amethyst, you are overdoing it.
Uh, chill it, dude.
Just because you can shapeshift doesn't mean you should.
- Can you shapeshift? - Well, of course Well, of course I can.
I'm perfect.
Whomp! Whomp! All Gems have shapeshift powers, Steven.
We can turn into objects, we can change parts of our bodies, or we could do
that.
Whomp! Whomp! I want to try it all! Don't bite off more than you can chew,
Steven.
- Whomp! Whomp! - Ugh! All right! Show me how to change into a huge lion!
Actually, for once, Pearl is right.
If you're gonna do this, you gotta start with something easy.
Like that cat you turned into? That sounds good.
Now follow my lead.
First: think of what you wanna be, and then just shake it out.
See? Now your turn.
Okay.
Ca-a-a-a-a-t.
Nah, you're too tense.
Just relax and feel it.
Biorhythms, yo'.
Fe-e-e-e-el it.
Eeeh, if you are not ready, we can try later.
No way.
I can do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, it was a good try.
This is so cool! You should go show your Dad.
He's gonna freak out! Dad, I'm back.
- Hey, Stu-ball.
- Check it out.
- I shapeshifted my finger into a cat.
- Whoa! Is that a thing you can do now? That's pretty cool.
I know.
Right? I'm gonna take this show on the road.
That'll be $1.
05, Steven.
Mmm, okay.
Here's a nickel.
And a buck! - Whaaaat? - Whaaaat? Oh, Steven, that's adorable.
- Are you making it purr? - It kind of does what it wants.
Really? - Ow! - See what I mean? - Bad cat finger! - Ah, I'm sure it just wants
to play.
You are right! And he doesn't have any friends.
Oh, my gosh! "It's just like you, Steven.
" Hey, Petey! Whoa! You work the deep fryer now? Make me some fry bits.
Steven, I take my job seriously.
Please, use the actual menu.
- Give me the bits.
The bits! - All right, listen.
It'll be over sooner if you just give him what he wants.
Whoa.
Hey, hey! It's not for me.
It's for these guys.
- What the - Uh, here's your bits.
- I can't look away.
- Steven, that is freakish.
No, it's not.
It's natural.
Shake it out! - See? - Wow! You know who would love this? Your older brother.
Yo, Ronaldo! What's up, Dad? I gotta take a pic for "Keep Beach City weird".
- What's that? - It's my blog! Keep Beach City weird.
Can I see the picture? Yikes! Oh, ooh.
Sorry, guys.
I guess cat fingers don't function well as fingers.
Shh! I'm just getting a snack.
- Whoa! - Steven! Need some help? Nah, it's cool.
Oh, good.
See you later then.
Huh? We're taking the Gem sloop out to sea to fight a living island.
What? Uh Amethyst, wait! I wanna go on the Gem sloop! I want to see a living
island! Wait, wait, wait! Steven! Come on! You can make it! - Steven! What's
going on? - Uh i-it's nothing.
Uh, I just turned all my fingers into cats.
We have to stay and help Steven.
We can't.
This is a tectonic emergency.
We'll deal with Steven when we get back.
- Amethyst, I blame you for this! - Eh, that's fair.
Steven! Just try to stay calm! Enough! No more cat fingers.
I want Steven fingers! And I don't mean little me-heads on fingers.
I mean my regular fingers.
Oh! Stop! Amethyst! Pearl! Garnet! Dad! Hello? Who's there? We're closed.
Come back tomorrow Da-a-ad - Steven? - Dad! Help! The cat fingers are taking
over my body! Hold on! - I'll get you out of there! - Dad! No! Bad! Bad cat
fingers! Can't you make them go away? I tried, but it made it worse.
My life is over! I can't go on magic adventures! I can't even open the fridge.
And I'll never get to have another water fight with you, Dad, 'cause these
things hate water.
They hate water! Dad, spray me again! It's not enough water! Turn on the
superwash! No! I won't do it! It's too dangerous.
You've got to! I'm a monster! I'm an adorable cat monster! No, you're not!
You're my son! Dad, please! Dad.
We did it.
Steven! Okay, let me see it.
Well, you you you got them to go away? It just goes to show - always listen to
me and never listen to Amethyst.
That's fair.
It goes to show - you should have a little more faith in Steven.
Yeah, that would've been a total cat-tastrophe.
But I'm feeling much better meow! What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Okay,
that's enough.
Wait.
I've been coming up with cat jokes all morning.
You guys, I'm feline fine! Everything's purr-fect! Oh, come on! I'm just kitten
around!

Oh So, I don't see you around that often.
My dad works for a bunch of different beaches, so we are never in the same
place long.
I go on adventures with the Gems sometimes.
They usually say it's too dangerous for me though.
Do you always go in a bubble? No.
This is new.
I don't know what this is.
But it's okay! The Gems will know what to do.
Ohh, what? Hey, guys! Garnet, help! I don't think they can hear you.
Oh, that's right.
I told them not to watch.
We can just wait here until they come out.
No, no, no, it's okay! I've got other friends that can help! Way to go, Steven.
Is this your magic love bubble or something? Did you make it because you love
That's Lars.
We are basically BFFs.
He makes weird faces.
Lars, quit being a jerk and help! What? I'm helping Steven on his date.
You're embarrassing him.
Oh, I'm not He and Sadie run the Big Donut.
Do they get along? They're crazy about each other.
I'm gonna go try something else.
Anyway, this place has the best donuts.
I come here like every day.
My parents don't let me eat donuts.
They have trans fats.
Whaaaat? Well, it's still a cool place to hang out.
I have a better idea.
Whoa, a trawler.
And a little skipjack! You know a lot about boats.
That's what happens when you hang out at the beach, and don't swim, and don't
have friends.
Y-You look at boats.
Oh, hey! Onion! Onion! We need a harpoon gun! What? To pop the bubble! Can't we
just go back to your house? It's okay.
I'm a Gem.
Onion, we need a harpoon gun! Har poon guuuun! Haaaar poooon guuun.
Let me try! It just made more sense.
The trawler Funland? Yeah! Tons of horrible accidents happen here everyday!
There's gotta be something to break this bubble.
We just gotta find the right ride.
Yeah! The kiddie-coaster! All right.
We just roll down this ramp, as the carts are coming at us.
And the crash will break us free! What happens after the bubble pops? We'll be
free! Steven, this is a bad idea.
This will work! Where are we? The bottom of the ocean.
It's okay! Are we even close to the shore? Yeah, sure.
Let's start rolling.
It's a good thing this bubble is airtight.
Otherwise we'd be drowning right now.
Don't worry, Connie.
I have an idea that will definitely work.
When we get back A huge worm! It's okay! Look! It only wants to eat that bright
stuff.
See? Not scary at all! Sorry! Are you all right? It's not so bad! It-it's okay!
I uh It's not okay! You keep saying that, but you don't know what you are
doing! Now we are going to suffocate or starve at the bottom of the ocean.
And only my parents will notice, because no one else cares about me! I'm gonna
disappear without ever making a single friend.
We could be friends! I saw you at the boardwalk parade last year.
You dropped your bracelet.
I picked it up, but then I couldn't find you.
I saved it in the freezer, so it would last longer.
In case I saw you again.
You were the kid on the car-wash float.
You had soap bubbles in your hair.
I-I was supposed to be a scrub brush.
I'm sorry, Connie.
If I'd have returned your bracelet back then, you wouldn't be stuck in this
bubble with me now.
No, it's okay.
I'm having fun.
Come on, come on! Hide in the rocks, Steven! Why is it chasing us? The
bracelet! It eats bright stuff! Connie! Steven! Give me the bracelet! What?
It's okay! Now, go! Go! Run that way! I'm sorry! Steven! Steven! What's going
on? What did you do? It was incredible! Really? You mean it? Here's your
bracelet again.
Thanks! So, are you going to introduce us? Steven was so excited to meet you!
Right, Steven? Hey! Don't mess with his funky flow! Funky flow?

**** Serious Steven ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way that's why the people of this world - # believe in # -
# Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x08 - "Serious Steven"
Pay attention, Steven.
This is going to be your first - serious mission.
You need to be ready.
- Yes.
I'm ready.
- I'm so ready! - Steven, come on.
You're going to make yourself sick.
- Why did you bring that? - I don't know.
I was excited - and it's mine and I like it.
Wha - Steven, get back here! You could get seriously hurt.
- Steven, are you - I'm fine.
I'm good.
I'm just gooey.
Mmm.
Aah, they're in my eyes! They're just butterflies, Steven.
Well, they looked a lot bigger - when they were on my eyeballs.
- Steven, you're a riot.
I'm suddenly having second thoughts about bringing - Steven on this one.
- Shh.
Just look at him.
Now, let's go recover the gemstone.
Unbelievable.
This was once a gem battlefield.
Now it's wild strawberries as far as the eye can see.
Oh, that's what I love about the Earth.
Maybe this will be a light mission after all.
Oh! Maybe not.
Whoa! Whoa! Steven's the best! Steven's the best! - Why, thank you, temple.
- You're a doof.
Hey.
What's this thing? - It's like a cool floaty triangle thing.
- W-whatever it is, you probably shouldn't touch it.
Steven! What have we told you - about touching magical things? - Definitely
always never do it.
Whoa! Looks like we're gonna have to split up.
Right.
Steven and I will stay right here where it seems to be safe while you guys go -
and solve the mystery of this place.
- Wait.
I want to help - solve the mystery.
- Yeah.
Come on, Steven.
- Let's solve the mystery.
- Yeah! Mystery solvers! Nope.
No, no, no, no, no.
You two are a disaster waiting to happen.
- Steven goes with me.
- Really? Awesome! But remember this is a serious mission.
Understood.
Serious Steven Pearl, can you put me down? - What? Oh, yes.
Of course.
- I need to be standing, or else it doesn't work.
Serious Steven activate! - But this could be the teacups all over again.
- Hey! I've put that behind me.
Well, we're on a magic treasure hunt for some magic treasure junk something,
something, magic something Huh? - We need to stay on the glowing panels.
- Right.
Serious Steven go! Oh, yeah! Uh whoa.
Steven! Whoo-hoo! That was uh, seriously dangerous.
Thank you, Garnet.
We can take a break if you're not - feeling well, Steven.
- Huh? Oh, no.
- I-I'm okay.
Let's keep going.
- All right, but be careful.
You might trigger a trap with that gun show.
Right.
I'll put these babies away and use my minds.
Maybe there's a clue hidden in these ancient drawings.
It looks like there's lots of triangles hidden somewhere in this room.
Run! - Oh, my ukulele! - Steven! Now is probably not the best time for that.
Oh.
Uh uh, right.
- Now, that was a pretty close one.
- Yeah.
That was a pretty close one.
Uh Get ready, Steven.
This is gonna be intense.
- Get ready, Steven.
This is gonna be intense.
- I'm ready! I misunderstood the point of this ride.
- This is fun, Steven.
- I think - I need to get off this ride now.
- Steven, no! Steven, you are banned from all the rides forever! - Whoa.
We made it? - I carried you while - you took a nap.
- B-but nap?! - We're back where we started.
- What?! Garnet, there you are! The doors and rooms here make no sense.
They all bring you back here.
- Get me out of here! - There are 16 doors, and we entered from the Northeast
and went through three consecutive rooms in a straight line - Ow! - but arrived
back here out the Southernmost door, which can only mean w-well, I don't know
what it means.
I - this is a death trap! - What what do we do? We go back in again and again
and again and again.
I can't! - Steven.
- It's okay.
No.
No, it's not.
You were all right about me.
I wanted to do this so bad, but now I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
- This is just like the teacups! - Oh, Steven.
I didn't really mean that.
Wait! Ah! Wait, you guys! What if this is just like the teacups? That's why
we're getting so lost.
That's why I'm feeling so sick.
All the rooms are spinning us around so we end up here.
Whoa! This is unbelievable.
This gem-powered mechanism it's manipulating the rooms above.
Every room we entered spun us until we came back to the central chamber.
It's just like the teacup ride at funland.
- Steven already figured that out.
- Oh.
Garnet, I need to get off the ride now.
Serious Steven go! Whoa! Huh? - Ah! - Huh? Steven? Steven! Where is he? - Oh,
he's over here.
- The gem.
- I'd say you handled that adventure very well.
- Yeah.
- Nice job, Serious Steven.
- I prefer regular Steven.
Hey! My ukulele.
Oh, that's the end of another day it was mighty serious, I'd have to say the
Crystal Gems looked really cool when they made the temple explode They're in my
eyes again!

Millionaire
****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e09 Episode Script ******
**** Tiger Millionaire ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x09 -
"Tiger Millionaire" How could you possibly think punching a blood polyp was a
good idea? Look at all the gunk you got on me! And look at Steven.
- It's not so bad once you get used to it.
- See? He likes it! He certainly won't like it when it hardens.
- Uh what? I'm gonna go wash.
- He shouldn't have been - so close in the first place.
- How was I supposed to know they'd pop? - Uh, guys? - You're always putting us
in danger with your little outbursts! Oh, you are just so childish! Yeah, yeah.
Don't forget "reckless," "vulgar," "loudmouth," and that's just what makes me
so awesome, right, Garnet?! Amethyst, you are a Crystal Gem.
- You need to act like it.
- Fine.
I think we really got through to her.
- Right, Garnet? - Guys? Huh? Wha? Amethyst? For those of you befuddled by the
events of athleticism, you're about to see the Purple Puma is the single, most-
hated wrestler in Beach City - underground's history! - What? All right, ladies
and gentlemen.
Let's introduce his opponent or should I say victim? - The Lochness Blogster! -
I'm going to end your reign of terror! Yaah! - Ugh.
- Well, now, that that was quick.
Yeah, yeah, I don't like it, either, but hey, what do you do? Amethyst! What
are you doing here? - Are you a secret wrestler? - Yeah.
But how? But when? But why? Come here.
Let me explain something to you.
In the ring, nobody can tell me what to do! And if they try, I hit 'em in - the
face with a chair! - And people like that? Like it? They love it! Well, they
hate it, but it's all part of the fun, you know? E-everyone here gets that.
You don't know what it's like having Pearl and Garnet - on your back all the
time! - Are you kidding me?! Oh, Steven, I told you before not to take peanut
butter on missions! I'm not going to say anything, but I expect you to
understand that that was wrong.
Let me be a wrestler with you! I'm so stifled! Well, I haven't won the tag-team
belt yet, but you - can't tell Pearl and Garnet.
- Deal! Are you ready?! Presenting Tiger Millionaire rich, feline industrialist
from jungle island! Once the single child of the wealthy Tiger family, he
clawed out his own destiny - making money in the coconut mines.
- Wow! You just came up with all that? - Well, yeah.
What's your back story? - Pumas are cool.
Uh W-we'll workshop that later.
Two local heroes in the ring tonight.
They build hospitals for the sick, and they build muscles that look slick.
Give it up for Concrete Heat and Chunk Truck! Facing off against the Purple
Puma and our newest, mew-est competitor Tiger Millionaire! - That little guy's
gonna get creamed.
- From here, he kinda looks like Steven.
- Yeah, right.
- Steven, wait.
I'm just using you to get the tag-team belt.
I'll do all the actual fighting.
- Do I still get to wear the costume? - I don't care.
Okay! Ooh, a devastating move by Puma! U-uh, Purple Purple Puma! Look out! What
a gross misuse of safety equipment and your tax dollars.
- That's not fair.
- It may not seem fair, - but hey, anything goes in wrestling.
- It does? Oh, yes, it does! Looks like this Tiger's got to turn cheetah! Hey,
chunk truck! I'll give you a million - jungle bucks to throw the match! -
What's this? It looks like Tiger Millionaire - is offering a bribe! - Why, we
could fill 1,000 potholes with Oh, snap! Did you see that?! Oh-h! - Oh! I mean,
just, wow.
- Way to go, Tiger! Ye-eah! Record-breaking heat tonight, folks.
Could it be? Tiger Millionaire has bought out our soda stand.
Maybe he'll share with his thirsty fa oh! Now there's no sodas for anybody.
Wha and now he's putting on galoshes?! Wow, folks.
This is really hard to watch.
Classic.
Tiger! Hey, Tiger! W-would you sign this? - It'd be so rad! - You couldn't
afford it! Who-o-o-a.
Never thought I'd live to see the day when a contender turned on his own fans.
I thought we were just having fun! Tiger Millionaire, you are the cruelest
creature on the planet! Hey, Tiger! Are you ready to win our final match?!
Amethyst, am I the cruelest creature on the planet? Oh, Steven.
Those are just words people use to describe how they feel about you.
Listen, Steven.
You can't let anyone make you feel like garbage.
- Is that how you feel? - I only feel how I want to feel.
Ladies and gentlemen, fans of wrestling, welcome to the tag-team championship!
In the ring tonight they've stomped their way through the tournament and into
our hearts.
Give it up, y'all.
Give it up for Dashing Dave Doober and Handsome Hank Hackleschmidt! Only one
thing would make these men look better, folks it's the tag-team belts! But
standing in their way, the ruthless kings of the jungle.
They'll eat your kids and fire your parents! Oooh! Yes, it could only be the
Purple Puma and Tiger Millionaire! Don't you dare hurt those men, you monsters!
Man, people are really hating on Tiger M.
He's awful because he hurt me specifically! Pearl? Uh, Garnet? - What are you
doing? - What are we doing? What is this? I thought we could use some
promotion.
Looks like we have some new opponents! No, you don't! This match is cancelled.
- What? - What? Why? Why?! I can't believe you've been sneaking off to this
this circus of violence! And you! Using your gem powers on humans? It's not
enough that you're on my case all the time? - You have to ruin this for me,
too? - We're not here to fight.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! - Steven, Amethyst - What?! - go back
to the temple.
- I don't wanna! Don't do this.
Guys! Stop! Wait! I want to tell you Purple Puma's back story.
He was the wildest cat in the jungle so wild, the other cats couldn't take it.
So she I mean, he went to look for somewhere he fit in somewhere with other
people who - felt misunderstood.
- That really sounds like Steven.
- Shh! - That's why we're all here to be wild and free and body-slam each other
and wear cool costumes and make up nicknames, and and uh, so can't we just have
this? Can't we just wrestle? No.
Because we are the notorious o-order of wrestling haters.
That's right.
Um we want to stop all wrestling everywhere! You're going to let us destroy all
wrestling? You got to save wrestling! Come on! Tiger! Puma! Tiger! Puma! We'll
stop you! What a stunning turnaround! The jungle duo are fighting back! And
they've taken down Captain Square.
But wait.
Wait.
It's the it's the good-looking gang with a ladder! A-are they planning to steal
the belt? No! Ooh, they're actually helping Tiger up! - He's climbing an actual
- Sorry for, um sorry.
- Same here.
- Tiger Millionaire has claimed the tag-team belts! Tiger and Puma have won the
- championship and saved wrestling! - Lars, I'm really confused.
I love you, Tiger Millionaire.

Steven's Lion W-water.
Uh so thirsty - for water.
- It'll be safer if you - stand up and walk.
- You don't understand.
This is how you're supposed to act in the desert.
- Is this the thing? The place? - Yes, Steven.
- The power in this structure has turned aimless.
- It's building columns with no roofs stairs that go nowhere.
This is out of control.
Then I guess we better Whoops! roll on over there.
- That was a bit unnecessary.
- Nan nani ni nun-nani nani! Excuse me? - What was that? - Let's go! It'll be
best if you stay here, Steven.
- We'll be quick.
- What if something eats me? Do not worry, wet one.
There's nothing out here that can harm you.
See you soon.
Okay.
Whew! It's so desert.
What was that? Nothing can harm me.
I am the wet one.
Good thing this column was here.
No, no, no! No! No! Huh? Huh.
Don't bite.
Aww.
You just wanted attention.
Didn't you? Didn't you? Your mane it's so soft.
So you from around here? I'm just here on business.
I really like your pink fur.
You're like the cotton candy of the jungle! I always wanted an animal friend,
but I thought ooh! it would be like a goldfish or a dinosaur! But I guess fate
had other plans for Steven Universe uhh! and his best friend lion.
- Amethyst, bubble it away! - No! - Quit being jealous, Pearl.
My kill, my keep.
- I'm not jealous.
Just be careful! If you drop it on the sand, it'll rebuild everything! Garnet,
Amethyst, and Pearl are coming.
- Quick, put my head in your mouth.
- Steven! What is that?! - What are you doing?! - Uh stop! It's okay! - Look,
he's totally tame! - That's impossible.
No, it isn't.
I taught him to say "I love you.
" I love you.
That's so sweet! I-I love you, too.
Get your hands out of that thing's mouth.
We have to get the desert glass out of the desert! - I got it.
- Let's go, Steven.
Okay.
Give me a sec.
Hey, lion, I got to go.
I had a lot of fun.
I feel like you really get me.
Shhhh.
This is already too hard for the both of us.
Amethyst, that pillow needs to be contained! Yeah, yeah.
I know what to do with it.
- What's that sound? - All I hear is your mouth.
I thought gems don't need sleep.
We don't.
Feels good, though.
Probably some kid trying to sell me lava insurance.
Hold your britches! Lion! Oh! Oh, my gosh! This is such a surprise! You came
all this way to see little old me? Whoa! You're fresh.
You can't go in there.
Amethyst is pretend sleeping.
But whatevs.
We're together again.
Now we can do everything best friends do! Okay, here I come! I'm gonna jump!
Get into position! Ready?! And catch me! I'm jumping! Catch me! I'm falling! Do
it! Catch me! I'll die! Eee! Okay, obviously, you're not into this Wah! Uhh!
Ooh! game.
Okay! Gonna throw this ball! Here it comes! Whaaaat?! That throw was so good!
Lion, all you got to do is catch it in your mouth.
See? Aww.
Pfft! Ugh.
You don't like that one, either? Okay, wait! I've got something you've got to
like! Fish stew pizza! Cats love fish.
Everybody loves pizza.
So you're gonna love this! Whoa! This place is jumpin'! Wait here.
We're gonna blow some minds.
Hey, guys! I'm doing okay, you know? Just getting some pizza.
Kofi.
Kiki.
- What are you having, Steven? - Large pizza, please.
Extra fishy.
- You must be hungry! - I'm ordering for two.
- Steven's pregnant?! - I don't think so.
- But I have a giant pet lion right outside! - You're not lyin', are you?
That's funny! But I'm not.
I believe it! Lot's of weird stuff happens in Beach City.
You'd know if you read my blog "keep Beach City weird"! I also have buttons!
Just go outside, and see for yourselves! - This is amazing! - Mm-hmm! - It's
invisible! - Huh? What? He's not invisible.
He's pink.
Pink? How can he be invisible and pink? There's nothing out here, Ronaldo.
Steven was lyin'.
Sorry for using the same pun twice.
- Bet you're not even pregnant.
- No, I'm telling the truth! He's real! Onion, you believe me, right? Huh? Hey!
Hey! Lion! You left me at the pizza place! I looked like a fool! I had to eat a
whole pizza by myself! Lion! Lion, no! Lion? Uhh! Ahh.
Keep it down, Steven.
What was that for? The pillow? Is this what you wanted? This pillow? I've been
trying to play with you and feed you 'cause I thought we were best friends.
Did all of that mean nothing to you? Fine! I don't care! If you want it, you
can have it! Steven! The desert glass! It's rebuilding its castle.
Why didn't you bubble it earlier? - Welcome to shrug city, P.
- Don't move! - We're coming! - Okay! Uhh! Huh? There it is the pillow! I have
to get it off the sand.
Huh? This wall's not moving! - We got to get through before things get any -
Whoa! No! Lion! You didn't come here to steal the pillow.
You came here to protect us from it! It's there! It's putting up defenses! How
are we gonna get up there?! Yup.
Sounds good.
Let's go.
Now, lion! Whoo! Roar! We should have done this in the first place.
- In my defense, I forgot.
- So I guess this is goodbye.
We had some good times.
But I'm sure you have other magical stuff to smash with other magical boys.
I love you, Steven.
I want to stay with you forever.
Really?! - Guys, you hear that?! - Are we really going to let him keep that? -
We kept Amethyst.
- Oh! "Kept Amethyst.
" Oh, Garnet! That's priceless! Yay! Lion! Wink!

ventions! Humans find such fascinating ways to waste their time.
- Pearl! - Huh? Pearl, come on! You'll love this game! If you say so.
"Road killer"? Yeah! Pick the car you like.
Then just go for it! W-which one of these buttons is my turn signal? None of
them.
Have fun! - Vroom, vroom! Kill the road! - O-kay? This is skee-ball.
Roll the ball into the hole, and you can even win tickets for prizes.
Whoa! Onion's the ticket master! - Cool.
- All right.
Good luck.
- Teens of rage! - Garnet, this game is perfect for you! You seem like a Joe
Rock kind of gal.
His special move is forward, forward back, top towards half circle, medium kick
Oh, wait.
Maybe that's - an aerial move! Just punch, and you'll be fine.
- Come on, chump! - I did it.
- Uh let's try something else.
O-o-okay! This is a game you can actually punch! Come on, give it the best
shot, kid! - Tell my wife I'm sorry! - I win again.
Uh Um Uh, how 'bout that one? Meat beat mania! There's no violence in this

it! That's it! Well done! Keep it up! Now you're cooking! Ooh, tasty! Keep it
up! Awesome! Garnet, you're so good at this! Whew! - I wonder how the others
are doing.
- You're horrible! - Stop saying that! - Uh, having fun? Why am I doing so
badly? - I haven't crashed into anything.
- You're supposed to - crash into everything.
- What?! That's horrible! - you're horrible! - Amethyst! - What are you doing?!
- I'm-a win a airplane! That's cheating! You're gonna get us in so much tro
Hey! Do you guys know what happened to Teens of rage? - Let's run! - This place
is fun! - Pearl, we're leaving! - Good! - You're fantastic! - Garnet, we're
leaving! What happened to punch buddy? - Who did this to you?! - Uh, see you at
home! So, w-what's today's mission? I hope it's - fighting a giant foot! - If
we're supposed to fight a "giant foot" Garnet would let us know.
- Yeah.
Garnet's the boss.
- Well, we're all a team.
Garnet just has heightened perception that guides us towards our mission
objectives.
- Yeah She's the boss.
- So, where is she? - F-fighting the foot? - She's not "fighting the foot.
" You know Garnet goes off on missions without us all the time.
She's probably doing something very important.
Oh, wait, Steven! I just remembered Garnet had a special mission for you.
- Really?! - Yeah! She says, um - "you have to slam your face into that bowl of
cereal.
" - Okay.
Good job, Steven! You stopped the foot! - There is no foot! - Not anymore.
- Ugh! - Well now that that's done, time to comb the beach for quarters with my
metal mutt! Silver dollar? Useless! Come on.
This better not be another cat.
Double dogs! Quarters! Help! Steven! It's the little guys! They're everywhere!
Why didn't we see this coming?! We need Garnet! We don't know where she is!
Meat beat mania! - Steven, where are you going?! - Huh? Garnet! You got to come
quick! Whew! Garnet! Those little guys are back, and and they're a problem!
Whoa.
Wh-o-o-a-a! I've never seen anyone get this far! B-b-but you gotta get back and
help the others! Uh, Garnet? Garnet, come on! Garnet! Hey! This is serious!
Pearl and Amethyst are in trouble! Garnet, why are you so hard to climb?!
Garnet! - That's rare! - Oh, my gosh! I'll save you, Garnet! Well done! Tasty!
Now you're cookin Meat the beat! Time to turn up the heat.
The rhythm has her.
The only way to defeat the beat - is with meat.
- A new cook has entered the kitchen.
I have to win! Let's meat it! Prepare your meats! Shake it! Tenderize! Player 1
wins! You're toast, player 2.
Eat it up! - A player 2 barbecue! - Aw, no! My last shot! Let's meat it! Rack
those ribs! Spice it up! Thrill is in the grill.
You're toasted.
This is it! Player 1 wins! You're toast, player 2.
I can't do it! Garnet, snap out of it! What's wrong with you?! You've got to
stop playing this horrible ga-a-a-me! - Steven! - Garnet! - You won.
- Huh? Huh?! It was you! You've been breakin' my games! Pearl! Amethyst! I can
help, too! Oh, no! No, no! Don't you go flippity-floppin' out of here! Yeah!
I'm working! See? - Hmm?A quarter! - Now you're cookin'!

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e12 Episode Script ******
**** Giant Woman ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way that's why the people of this world - # believe in # -
# Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x12 - "Giant Woman" -
Ha! Take that! - Wow, Amethyst, I'm impressed.
- Now it's your move, Pearl! - Steven, are the water - balloons really
necessary? - Yeah! This way the moves really matter.
But it's checkers.
Every single move matters.
It sounds like someone's being a sore loser.
I'm not a sore loser because I just won the game.
Whaaaa? Here it comes.
Ahh, it feels good to lose.
I certainly hope that's not the attitude you have during battle.
You're no fun anymore.
This is why we never form Opal.
We don't form Opal because you're difficult and a mess.
We don't form Opal because you're uptight and - Guys! Guys! What is Opal?! -
Oh, it's the two of us - mashed together.
- Is water just hydrogen and - oxygen "mashed together"? - Uh Analogy wasted.
Look here, Steven.
When we synchronize our forms, we can combine into a powerful - fusion gem
named Opal.
- Except I don't dance like that.
- Amethyst! - Wow! That's so cool! - But tell me more about Opal! - Well,
Steven, she's an ultra-powerful, stone-cold betty.
That part's me.
And she's, like, kind of tall.
- That part's Pearl.
- What Amethyst is attempting to say is Opal is an amalgam of our combined
magical and physical attributes - fused into a single entity.
- Wow! Can you do it right now? - Come on! Form Opal! - Pfff! We only form Opal
when it's absolutely necessary.
Garnet's back! Ooh! Ooh! Did you bring me anything? Whoa! A rock! - Thanks,
Garnet! - So, was your mission a success? I've located the geode beetles of
heaven and Earth.
- We should split up to retrieve them.
- Well, I'm going with not Pearl.
That's perfect because I don't want to go with - grammatically incorrect people
anyway.
- Is her talking about me? You three go together.
I go alone.
- What? Why? - The Earth beetle is at the bottom of the boiling lava lake, and
only I can swim in lava.
You'll find the heaven beetle at the top of the sky spire.
It's safer.
- You mean boring-er.
- You mean "more boring.
" So you agree with me.
Come on, you two.
Let's go.
Steven, be sure to keep the harmony.
No problem.
Today's gonna be all about ha-a-a-a-rmo-o-o-o-o-ny! Ugh! - Whoa! Is this where
the heaven beetle lives? - Apparently.
- All the way at the top.
- So, when you fuse, do you turn into a giant giant woman or just a regular-
sized giant woman? - Ugh.
- Does one of you control the right arm - and the other control the left arm? -
Come on, Steven.
Wait! These are extremely important questions.
Whew! There sure are a lot of stairs.
How about you form Opal and give - me a piggyback ride? - No! What about if you
eat a hot dog? Whose stomach does it go into, or do you share the same stomach?
That would be gross.
Look out! It's a magical goat guardian! Quick! You have to form Opal! It's the
only way to defeat it! Hurry before it kills us all! Steven, we only fuse for
deadly situations.
Does this look like a deadly situation? Ow! Hey! Bad mountain goat! Darn it.
Aw, I'm never gonna get to see Opal.
all I wanna do is see you turn into a giant woman a giant woman all I wanna be
is someone who gets to see a giant woman all I wanna do is help you turn into a
giant woman, a giant woman all I wanna be is someone who gets to see a giant
woman oh, I know it'll be great and I just can't wait to see the person you are
together if you give it a chance, you could do a huge dance because you are a
giant woman you might even like being together and if you don't, it won't be
forever but if it were me, I'd really want to be a giant woman a giant woman
all I wanna do is see you turn into a giant woman Ooh! - Wait up, Steven Jr.
! - Wait! - Steven, I'm not sure you can make those jumps.
- Oh! You should fuse into Opal, and then lay across the rocks like a bridge! -
We don't need Opal to get across.
- Can you do it anyway? - Please? It would be easier, wouldn't it? - Not as
easy as this! Waaaahhhhh! Ooooh! Ooh.
Wow, Amethyst.
That was a really good idea! I know.
I'm full of 'em.
Aw, come on, Pearl! It's safe! Just look! That was so great how you worked
together.
Why don't you do that all the time? I can't feel my legs anymore! - Hey, look
at that! It's a tiny temple! - It's just where Garnet said it would be.
The heaven beetle should be inside.
Check it out! It's even got a little beetle bedroom and little beetle bongos
and a little beetle baby book.
But where's the beetle? It's supposed to be here.
The heaven beetle wouldn't leave, would it? Oh, it could be anywhere! Uh, maybe
you should freak out some more.
- That's really gonna help us find it.
- I can't believe your attitude, Amethyst.
And now you're just slouching over here doing nothing! Hey! It's not my fault
the beetle isn't there! Why do you have - to make things worse by squawking at
me? - I don't squawk! Yeah, you're squawking and commenting on my posture! Hey!
Cut it out! You're scaring Steven Jr.
! My son.
- In here, guys! - It swallowed my spear! Guys, this is great! Now's the
perfect time for you two to form Opal! Oh, brother.
Ugh! So, you wanna try that again with less hitting - me in the face this time?
- Well, it would have worked if your - movements weren't so erratic and
formless.
- So, it was all my fault? You totally weren't even trying to sync with my
dancing.
- You should know how I dance by now! - Stop! Come on, guys! Please stop
fighting! If you can't get along with each other, I might never get to see your
awesome fusion power! And I might get eaten by a giant bird! - Steven! - Unh!
Steven Jr.
! How can you eat at a time like this? Hey, is that the heaven beetle? Let me
see it! Hey! Be a good goat and give me the magic bug! I got it! No! B-bad
goat! You're no son of mine! What's going on?! Steven Jr.
! Oooh! Opal? Hup! Stay low.
Uh do you know who I am? all you wanna do is see me turn into A giant woman.
We're back! - The heaven beetle.
- I don't have it.
- Unh! - Amethyst, you got distracted! Hey! You were the one getting carried
away - with all those fancy backflips! - Wait a sec.
I've got the beetle! Good job, Steven.
I also see you helped your teammates fuse.
And all I had to do was get eaten by a bird.
Nice work.
You'll be great at fusing one day.
Yeah.
Wait.
I can do that, too?!

Birthdays
****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e13 Episode Script ******
**** So Many Birthdays ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x13 - "So
Many Birthdays" - How can you live like this?! - It was fine till - you guys
started whining.
- Whining?! The whole temple reeks! - I found it! - What manner of magical
alloy is this? - It's a burrito.
- It's the tuna burrito from Aqua-Mexican! That place closed like 5 years ago.
Huh? What's this? It kind of looks like you guys - and my Mom.
- Oh, Steven, that is us! - Really? - The hard part was getting the shark to
pose.
- Why's everyone dressed like old-timey people? - They are old-timey people.
W-wait.
But that would mean - How old are you guys? - Much older than any human.
- Does that mean you'll live forever? - No, no.
We don't age, but we can still get hurt and die.
But not from food poisoning.
I just can't believe you guys are like a bazillion years old! How do you find a
cake big enough for all those candles? - We don't really celebrate birthdays.
- Why not?! - It's not our way.
- Well, I can't just ignore this tramesty of unjustice! I pledge that you will
have your birthdays! With all the candy, cake, and ice cream you've been
denied! And the birthday queen is Amethyst! I hope you like it.
Dad made me this outfit and it brings me special birthday luck every year! It
might as well be your birthday so why don't we have a party? even if your age
isn't real and your body's an illusion Hey! It goes like this.
- Lion, you're killin' me.
- Um, Steven I know you put a lot of effort into putting faces on things, but
could it be we're just a tad mature for this ritual? - Boop! - Oh! You will
remove that - this instant! - Wait! Here! - Aww! I'll use it all the time! -
No! It's for the piÃÂ±ata! The piÃÂ±ata is an artifact from ancient aqua
Mexico.
Am I getting - close? - Higher.
- What next, Steven? - Well, you were supposed to get - delicious candy when
you broke it open - Wait.
- You had candy you didn't just give it to us? - There will be more sweet
treats at Pearl's party.
I promise.
Happy birthday! - Honk! - Steven, that is a brave look.
- No, it's funny! - How? Uh Oh, geez, I'm breaking character.
Wait, wait, wait! I wrote some jokes! Why did Pearl throw butter out the
window? - You did what? - To see a butterfly! I never did that.
Steven, are you telling lies? N-no! Oh! I know.
- Pearl, do you like pie? - I do like pie.
Well, you're in luck! I baked you a pie! - I sure hope nothing happens to it! -
Yes, me too.
- Wh-whoops! - Whoa, Steven! I've got you! Be careful.
You almost fell right on that See, Pearl? It's funny! Pearl says she's all
partied out - and she's ready to go home.
- This isn't going at all like it should.
I've got to pull out the ultimate birthday.
Okay, there's no way you're not gonna love this! It's kazoo racers! You get in
a car, you play a kazoo What more could you want? - Dad used to do this for me
every year.
- I think this is why - aging makes humans die.
- Steven, thank you for the birthday parties, - but I don't think we'll need
any more.
- Why not? Our age is only an illusion.
And Pearl's pretty sure this ritual is - more for human children.
- Nothing against children! Children? Everyone gets to have birthdays!
Seriously.
Give it a try! You're never too old! - We're just too big.
- You're not too big.
- Y-y-you just get in and then, uh - I can fit! Which way to the baby war? Eat
tread, dirtbags! What if birthdays are just for little kids? - What if even I'm
too old? - No way.
You totally fit! Oh, my bad.
You are too old.
- Are you okay? - I just need to think.
Kazoo racers suddenly seems undignified.
I never realized birthdays meant leaving things behind.
All these parties Ugh! So embarrassing.
Oh, onion so young, so innocent.
Whackerman Jr.
! Aww I can't be seen playing childish games like Whackerman Jr.
I better stick to sophisticated games like regular Whackerman.
It's whackin' time! You're gonna get whacked! Ohh! That was fun, but a boy on
the cusp of manhood can't spend the whole day whackering.
I need to take control of my life.
It's time to get a proper job! But which one? Surf master? No.
Love doctor? I'm too squeamish.
Ah! Now this is the job for me.
Ha.
This day went so fast.
I need a pick-me-up! - Two of the usual, please! I've had quite a day.
- You must be confused, pal.
I work here every day and I've never seen your mug before.
Oh, hardy-har, Lars! - Huh? - I used to make jokes! But you know what? I've had
a lot of time to think today, and sometimes you got to smarten up, act like an
adult.
'Cause one day, if you don't, everyone you know is gonna grow up without you!
And you won't have little Steven to pick on anymore because I'll be a grown-up,
too! - Steven who? - Steven Quartz Universe! And I want that doughnut, right
there! Oh! - Sir! A-are you okay? - I'm old! - Yeah, and nuts.
- I'm gonna have to eat fiber cereal.
All my teeth are gonna fall out.
And then I'll have to eat oatmeal, and it'll be sugar-free! Sugar fre-e-e-e! I
need to reverse this! I need a reverse birthday! The king costume.
Will you help me into my birthday suit? Yeah, you better run! Ohh! I'm too old
for this.
Lion! You know - Steven was right.
This is fun.
- You don't have to - keep wearing that stuff.
- It makes me feel important.
- Steven! What's wrong with him? - He's okay! - He's just really, really,
really, really old.
- Gems can't die from aging - But he's half human.
- Can't we fix him? My birthday suit might help.
Good as new! Right? Thanks, guys.
But I guess this suit's all out of birthday magic.
We had a good run, huh? - More birthdays now.
- Check it out, b-day boy! - Heh, I'm a tiny car! - Beep beep.
Kids stuff? Eh, piÃÂ±ata time! - It's not working! - Pearl, get over here! - I
can't! - For Steven! Oh, look I have what, uh what appears to be a delicious
pie! I sincerely hope that nothing happens to Oh, Steven! Are you trying to
kill him faster?! Pearl! - Garnet! - Garnet, stop! I thought violence would be
the answer.
I think the party approach was working.
Would you guys just please control yourselves?! Uh Oh, no.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have yelled.
But I can't stand to see - you freaking out like this! - Wha? - Steven, you're
changing! - Your age is fluctuating! I think your gem is reacting to your state
of mind! - Steven, stop feeling old! - But I wasted your time.
- We all have such little time - Steven! You have to feel like yourself sweet
and considerate - and only occasionally obnoxious.
- Do you really think I'm all those things? - Yes! - Why else would you throw
us all those parties? Oh, my gosh.
You're right.
I am pretty great.
Oh, Steven! Steven! We'll work on the rest later.

**** Lars and the Cool Kids ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # and Steven! 1x14 -
Lars and the Cool Kids - This doesn't look good at all.
- Whoa! Cool! - No, Steven! - Don't get near that stuff! - Whoa! Steven's here!
- You have to be - careful, Steven! - Why? - What is that stuff? - It's the
moss that Rose Quartz raised on the hill.
- My Mom planted this stuff? - Rose Quartz used to climb that hill every spring
and tend to the moss at the top.
But now that Rose is gone, - the moss is on the move.
- It's lost.
- It's not lost.
It's gross.
- Yes, but Rose loved it anyway.
She saw the beauty in everything, no matter how gross.
Fortunately, I know just what to do in this situation.
Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h! Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h! This is why I get up in the morning.
- Is this police tape? - Isn't this great?! This way we don't even have to use
magic.
Humans will just see this and walk away.
- Don't hold back.
- I never do! fa la-la la-la perfect! Now we can come up with a plan to move
the moss back to its hill.
Who wants to get some lunch? Just me, then? Nice.
# Gettin' me a P, gettin' me a ZA # gettin' me a p-p-p-p-pizza gettin' me a P,
gettin' me a ZA Hey, is that Lars? Lars! - Why now? - Got a high five for you
from wa-a-a-y - downto-o-o-o-wn! Ohhhhhh! - No, Steven! No high fives! - Mmm,
okay.
- Steven! So how come you're not at the big donut? I don't spend my whole life
at work.
I do other things.
- Like standing against this wall? - What does it look like?! - Looks like
you're doing a lot of nothing.
- That's the plan, Ste-van.
- Just playing it cool today, you know? - We are so much alike.
- Excuse me? - You want to get a fresh pizza right out of the oven, but you
don't want to seem too desperate, right? Well, there's no need to be ashamed.
Just walk right in and ask.
That's what I always do.
- Steven, don't go in there right now! - Oh, hey! He opened the door, and there
was doggy doo everywhere.
That's nasty.
I don't like nasty stuff.
Isn't that Kiki's sister and her friends? - Jenny, Sour Cream, and Buck Dewey.
- Oh.
You know those guys? Not quite, but I'm sure we'll hang at some point.
- You should go in and talk to them.
- That's not how these things work, Steven! The plan is to keep it cool and let
them come to me.
- Here they come.
- Aah! Steven, turn around! Act natural! - Tell dad I'll be back later.
- I don't think they saw you.
Steven, you were blocking me with your big hair! Aaah! Sorry! I'll go tell them
to look over here! Steven, no! Don't go over there! I hate you! - Muffins that
are like this big.
- Those things are too sweet for me.
- Hi! My name's Steven.
- Buck Dewey.
- They call me "Sour Cream.
" - I'm Jenny.
Aah, he's gonna wreck everything! What are they saying? I can't hear them! Ugh!
Why is he dancing?! - No! My life is horrible! - Hey, Lars! - Yo.
- They invited us along for a ride.
Huh? W-wait a minute.
They? You? Steven, you got lucky.
So, don't ruin this with any of your lame shtick.
Pyoo, pyoo! You got it! - Hop on in, guys.
- Oh, yeah! Middle seat! - Where'd you get that rad shirt, Steven? - I have no
idea where - any of my clothes come from.
- Yeah, man.
Livin' free.
I like it.
- Hey, check out my shirt.
- Oh.
That snake is nasty.
- Oh.
Yeah.
I hate snakes.
- Oh, what? That's too bad.
Some snakes are pretty cool.
Sounds like it's time to buckle up! - Quit being lame, Steven.
- Hey, man, there's nothing lame about seat-belt safety.
- Car does not move till we're all buckled up.
- Yeah.
Now let's get some spaced-out beats up in here.
- Yeah.
I can rave to this.
- Hey, this car's really cool, Jenny.
It's just a delivery car for my Dad's lame shop.
- Makes me smell like pizza.
Where to, y'all? - I don't even know.
- Oh, can we stop by the big donut? - That old place? - Man, that place is a
drag.
- But that's where Lars works.
Quit it, Steven.
You need some water? Funland arcade is the best! Let's do that! Man, I beat all
the "G's" in there like 3 million times.
No way! - Yeah.
Me too.
- No way! Honestly, though, I'm just exaggerating to sound cool.
- I appreciate your honesty.
- Hey, Buck, isn't that your dad? Another reason you should re-elect me I love
babies! Will you look at that? A baby! Gonna kiss it.
- Hmm.
I like his policies on babies.
- Man.
He never kisses me like that.
- That's rough, bro.
- It's not rough.
The lack of daddy kisses - in my life made me who I am.
- Oh, my gosh, guys.
- We should check out dead man's mouth.
- What's dead man's mouth? Oh, it's this lake where some dude died or it looks
like a mouth.
- I forget the specifics.
- Dead man's mouth, here we come.
Sounds good to me! We're here.
Y-you know what? I know this place may seem cool, but it's actually a lot less
cool than you think.
Why don't we just go have some more fun at the boardwalk? Steven, stop being
lame.
Let's check this place out.
Oh, yeah.
Oh! Pff! The police tape! Huh.
Police tape? - Awesome.
- I'm above the law.
Who wants to go for a swim? Pants become shorts.
Lars, don't go in there! - It's dangerous! - Steven, you trying to scare us?
Build an atmosphere.
I appreciate that.
Ooooh.
- Wait! - I'm not that slow.
Hey, what are you doing, man?! Don't! Steven what is your deal?! - Ugh.
Ew! - Ohh! - Oh, no! Ugh! - What's going on?! It's some kind of magic moss my
Mom planted! Wait.
Your mom? Guys, hang on! Lars, I know what we have to do! This is all your
fault! I knew if something went wrong today, it would be because of you! Now
I'm never going to be friends with these guys, all because of your weird mom!
What do you know about my Mom?! I didn't even get to know my Mom! But I do know
she saw beauty in everything, even in stuff like this and even in jerks like
you! Now help me get them to the car.
- Hey! - Lars, hurry! This moss belongs on the top of that hill.
Come on, Lars! What are you waiting for?! Uh, Steven, I don't know how to drive
a stick shift! I'll work the stick.
You just keep us on the road.
- Okay.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ignition! - Stick problem! - Steven, no! Put it in reverse! - Is that the one
with "R" on it? - Jenny's gonna kill me! - Whoa! What's gonna happen when we
get to the top of that hill? - I don't know! - You don't know? That's just
where the moss wants to be! Aah! Huh? Aaaaaah! It's getting everywhere! We made
it! - We're almost there! What do we do now? - We got to get up there! Hurry!
Yeah! I'm getting stuck.
Ohh! - Oh! Don't give up! - Steven? - What? - This sucks.
Ohhhhh! Lars! The moss was just trying to bloom.
- Ugh.
What happened? - I think I died.
- Guys, look! - Whoa! - You can see all of Beach City from up here.
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.
How did we even get up here? - Well, Steven thought that Lars drove us here.
- Yeah, Lars.
- Supercool.
- You're cool, Lars.
- I can totally rave to this.
Go! Go! Go! Go! - Sour cream! - Sour cream! Yeah! Okay, that's enough.

**** Onion Trade ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day # and if you think we can't #
# we'll always find a way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x15 -
"Onion Trade" - Amethyst! - Outside, dude.
- Have you seen ranger guy? - Excuse me? Ranger guy.
One of my guys.
You know Guys? G.
U.
Y.
S.
! "Guys Under Your Supervision.
" There's ninja guy, construction guy, cop guy, Eye guy, invisible guy, jagged
guy, cat guy, apple guy, and my main man ranger guy, the best of all the guys.
- He's gone missing.
Have you seen him? - What's that I hear? You can't find your little men in that
super junky room of yours? It's not that bad.
- How'd that get in there? - You left your window - wide open for things to
just fly in and out.
- Aww, give him a break, P.
My room's messy, but I always find what I'm looking for.
- Then why haven't you found my magic ax? - I haven't looked for it yet.
Amethyst, go and find it right this second.
Hey, feel free to go look for it yourself.
There's no way I'm going into that dump.
Pearl, all your nagging's made Steven depressed.
- Is everything okay, Steven? - Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just have to break the bad news to my dad.
Dad! Dad! - I'm so sorry! - Yeah, you're sorry.
Sorry you walked through that door without a hose in your hand, ready for
battle! - Wait! - Man, you look sad and wet.
- What happened to your life, little guy? - I lost something.
- Something precious.
- Your innocence? I lost ranger guy.
One of my guys from our special day at the beach last summer.
You bought him for me at the end of the day.
He was one of a kind.
He had a miscolored hat.
- How could you not remember? - Oh.
Was this the same day we ate that awesome funnel cake? - Uh, huh? - Yeah, man.
That funnel cake - I even kept the plate.
Come on! - Cool balloons.
U, let's see here.
Got cans, napkins, oh, a yo-yo, a book about yo-yo tricks, a sandwich I've been
meaning to catch up on Ow, my butt! Wait.
What's your story again? I lost my special ranger guy, and I'm quite upset over
it.
Huh.
Well here's a bag full of quarters.
Now you can get all the guys you want.
- Thank you.
- What did you say? Thank you! We'll be reunited soon, ranger guy.
Here we go.
- And - Dave guy! - What?! - Lucky! Not lucky! He's, like, the worst guy.
Maybe he comes with something cool.
Taxes? Come on, Dave guy! Is this all you have to offer a bunch of paperwork?
Answer me! - Thank goodness I have all these qauarters.
- Dave guy! - No! - Dave guy! - Stop it! - Dave guy! Ranger guy! This machine
is out of guys.
Please try again another time.
It's over.
Huh? Oh.
Onion.
What are you doing? He's got a ranger guy?! Onion! Wait up! Let's trade! Which
way did he go? Oh! I guess he needs a suitcase.
Is he haggling with that guy? He's a tough customer.
Looks like they worked something out.
Huh? Did he get that guy's lunch? I wonder how this is gonna play out.
Oh, man.
Hey, good looking.
What the heck is he doing?! He's not even hungry?! Not the tomatoes! Huh? Hey.
Is that Onion's dad? I guess they don't need words.
Huh? He's leaving so soon? Does Onion just sit around and wait for his dad all
day? Ranger guy! Okay.
Let's do this.
Hey, Onion.
How are you? That's good.
That's good.
I couldn't help but notice that you're a guys fan.
You know, guys? The little man in your back pocket? Yeah, ranger guy.
How would you like to trade that boring old ranger guy for a brand-spanking-
new, mint-in-box Dave guy! Pretty nice, right? Oh.
I see where this is going.
You're getting quite the deal here with two Dave guys! Yeah! What? You want
more? Like two more? Five more.
10 more? This whole bag? All 30 of these Dave guys for just one ranger guy! But
there aren't any more.
The machine's empty.
I bought them all.
Where are you going? Hey! Let's work something out.
Ranger guuuuy! Ugh, stupid Dave guy.
Got no future, your haircut's gross, you smell bad - You talking about Pearl? -
No.
I'm talking about dumb, old Dave guy.
I mean, just look at him.
Does it look like his life is going anywhere? Ah, cut him a break.
Maybe this is the year he gets his life together.
Maybe he'll get a cool internship.
I doubt it.
I can't even trade 30 Dave guys with Onion to get one ranger guy! So, you need
more of that little man - to get some other little man.
- Yeah.
And the machine is sold out of them.
- What is that? - Pearl's replicator wand.
You can use it to make copies of stuff.
You're magic.
I'm sure you can figure out how to use it.
Have you been sitting here all day with this in your hair? Nah.
I got up to look for Pearl's dumb ax but found that instead.
Then I replicated a bunch of garbage and stuffed it all in Pearl's room.
Hey, Onion! That makes 31! You want more? How about 32? 33? 34? 36.
37.
39.
Enough! What is it that you want?! You mean you want this? For ranger guy? We
are on the scene with ranger guy on beach patrol.
Things are looking just great out here, Steven.
Yep.
Everything is great.
Great.
Were you always this boring, ranger guy? I used to be a doctor.
Maybe you're just more fun around other Guys? Dave guy? I thought I saw the
last of Uh.
Hey! What's the big i dea? Onion! This is ridiculous.
How did he get my replicator? That child should not be in possession of such an
item.
- Aren't these Steven's little men? Oh! - They're called "Guys!" Can you please
explain this mess? I traded that replicator for ranger guy.
Steven, why didn't you just replicate ranger guy? - Dang it! - Let's go before
this gets any worse.
Whoa! Uh.
How do you move in this stuff? - Try and act like a rich duck.
- What does that mean? Oh, my gosh! I just wanted some ice cream.
- Hi, Greg.
- What the heck is going on out here? Uh, you know, just doing our thing.
Hand it over.
It doesn't belong to you.
- This is not a game.
- What did he shoot? Go under! - At least it stopped raining toys.
- Ah! Rich duck! Ooooonion! Onion, please stop.
Let's trade back.
You take ranger guy.
He's the best.
He even has a miscolored h This is my ranger guy! You traded me my own guy! Our
trade didn't count.
That didn't work.
I'm never letting Amethyst borrow anything again.
- Garnet! - I'm not cleaning up this mess.
I think I understand why you took my ranger guy, Onion.
I bet you get pretty lonely waiting for you dad all day.
You were probably really bored, too.
And 'cause you missed your dad, you took my ranger guy, which is a symbol of
the relationship I have with my dad.
No? Just the first thing? Well, here.
You need him more than I do.
Let's go.
So, all the stuff that got copied turned into nothing? - Yep.
- Rats.
That was really cool what you did back there.
- Thanks, Dad.
- But you went through all that trouble for a toy? It was more about the
memories than the toy.
Now we have new memories - horrible, horrible memories.
- Aww.

**** Steven the Sword Fighter ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x16 -
"Steven the Sword Fighter" .
.
Oh, Lonely Blade, you so lonely.
.
.
What?! The janitor is the evil samurai president?! - That's bananas.
- Oh, come on.
It was so obvious.
He's been mopping in the background of every fight scene.
Look.
Here he is on the cover of the box.
Oh, yeah! .
.
.
Go, Lonely, go! - Do the boomerang blade again! - Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.
Just look at their form.
This is nothing like real sword-fighting.
Shh! It's just a movie, Pearl.
Well, if you ever want to see a demonstration of proper sword techniques, I'd
be happy to show you.
Now? All right.
In order to give a proper demonstration, I'm going to need a sparring partner.
Luckily, I have the perfect candidate right here.
- Cool! Hologram Pearl! - Ah, geez.
Do you wish to engage in combat? Let this be the perfect battle.
You've already made a mistake by challenging me.
We shall let our swords decide.
Nerd! - Shh! - Shh! Commencing duel.
Defense rank "S.
" Zero openings detected.
- Go, Pearl, go! - Go, Holo-Pearl! Opening detected.
Hah! Match.
Set.
Challenger wins! Whoo-hoo! Yay, Pearl! Do you wish to battle again? Pearl! That
was amazing! You were so cool! Oh, well.
One does try their best.
Will you teach me to sword-fight like you? All right, but we should start with
the basics.
Initiate training mode.
Training mode initiated.
Level 1.
begin! I want you to stand back, Steven, and watch me carefully, okay? Parry!
Parry! Thrust! Parry! Parry! Thrust! Do you see what I'm doing with my feet,
Steven? Parry! Parry! Thrust! Notice where I keep my center of gravity.
Aww.
Can you show me something cool, like the boomerang blade? Steven, you know
that's not a real sword technique.
Boomerang blade! Boomerang blade! - Boomerang blade! - Steven, these are real
sword techniques, not those silly things from your movie.
It's about waiting carefully for the perfect moment to Thrust! - Whoa.
- Oh, no.
- Pearl? - Whoopsy-daisy.
Steven, it's okay.
I'm gonna be just No! Pearl? Pearl! Challenger defeated! Level 1 failed.
- Steven! - Steven! I-I was just and and she was trying to Steven, it's okay.
Pearl's gonna be just fine.
- What do you mean? - Sometimes if our bodies are badly damaged, we release our
physical forms and retreat to our gems to regenerate.
- So, she's gonna be okay? - Don't worry, bud.
This kind of thing just happens sometimes usually to me.
- Always to you.
- Hey, I'm scrappy.
What do you want? So, how long will it take her to regenerate 5 minutes, 10
minutes? - What's taking so long? - What up? - He-e-ey.
- She's still not done? Man, she's really taking her time with this one.
Got to tell you, though, love what you've done with the place.
- Pearl usually helps me tidy up.
- Ah, I say leave it.
Hey, if real Pearl can't be here, there's always the next best thing! Do you
wish to engage in combat? Steven, cover that thing back up.
But it's like Pearl! Look at it! Ye-e-e-ah.
That ain't Pearl.
Well, maybe I can get it to act like her.
Here we have a mess.
Organizing messes is one of Pearl's favorite hobbies.
Here.
Pearl likes to organize them by type animal, humanoid, miscellaneous.
Now you try.
- You've drawn your sword in vain! - What?! Aah! Challenger defeated! Maybe we
need to try something else.
- I'm gonna do it.
- Go on, then.
Pearl always likes to tease Amethyst when she does funny stuff like this.
- I won't go easy on you this time! - That's the spirit! What are you rascals
doing over here? Draw your weapon, challenger! Ugh.
Steven, why are you still hanging out with that thing? It's gross.
I just really miss spending time with Pearl.
Pearl will come back to us in time, Steven.
Have patience.
And stop hanging out with that thing.
It's creepy.
- Wh-o-o-o-o-oa! - Hmm.
You had fun at the boardwalk, right? - Parry! - Aw, come on.
You got to work with me here.
This is Pearl's favorite tree.
Don't you recognize it? What's on your mind? Come on.
Don't hold back.
Challenge accepted! What?! Oh, no! The tree! Challenger defeated! Real Pearl
would never do that! Rah! You're hopeless! Get away from me! It's too bad
you're still not back, Pearl, because I just found a copy of the fifth "Lonely
Blade" movie! How long are you gonna make me wait, Pearl? Oh, the popcorn's
done.
Stay right there.
Do you wish to test your skills against me in a duel?! No! No sword-fighting!
Draw your sword and fulfill your destiny! Huh? No! Leave real Pearl and me
alone! Go back under your sheet.
- Brother, is that you? - Yes, it's me yourbrother.
Your technique is Whoa! This dub is really good.
- What do you think, Pearl? - Parry! - Brother! - Just wait a minute.
You're not my real brother! Aah! Boomerang blade! Your technique is impressive.
But it won't be enough.
It's about waiting carefully for the perfect moment to - Thrust! The TV! Why
must you destroy the things I love?! Challenger defeated! Continue? I hate you!
I hate you! You're nothing like Pearl! Pearl is smart, and she always wants to
protect me from danger! All you want to do is fight me! Challenge accepted! All
right, fine! Basic attack mode initiated.
Parry! Parry! Thrust! - Parry - Don't say that! Parry! Parry! Thrust! Basic
attack mode defeated! Now initiating advanced mode! Walrus shield.
Snacks, pillow, fuzzy flower, boomerang? Boomerang! Aah! Pearl! I should have
just waited for you to come back! I should have waited for the perfect moment!
Boomerang blade! Challenger wins! Do you wish to duel again? N-o-o-o-o-o! -
Steven, we heard fighting.
- Ow! Are you all right? What's going on? Oh, just mopping.
Die! You know, I might miss Pearl a whole lot, but sometimes you just have to
accept things the way they are before you Never mind! Pearl's back! That's much
better.
- Ohh! Hey! Miss me much? - Oh, man! I had this whole thing planned out for
when you came back! Uh, Steven, what happened to your room? I don't even want
to know what happened to you.
- I got hit by a airplane! - Pearl's back! Pearl's back! - Steven, what are you
doing? - Pearl's back! Pearl's back! Pearl's back! Ugh.
I can't leave you guys alone for a second.
Pearl's back!

We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x17 -
"Lion 2, The Movie" {Dogcopter 3 {This February Whoa! I can see why this is
your favorite film franchise! That's right.
In a world where humanity is pushed to the brink, it turns out - that the one
who is most human is a dog copter.
- And did you see where - that missile came out of?! - Yeah.
I just hope it stays faithful to the book.
- Ah - The Gems are back.
Greetings.
Oh! W-well, hello, Connie! What a surprise to see you! We're gonna watch a
movie about a wacky flying dog! Show them, Connie! I mean, it's about much more
than that.
- Oh, that's easy.
- Wha? Who needs to go see movies when you've got magic?! - Ugh.
- Aw, stop showing off, Amethyst.
Connie promises this movie's even better than any magic! - I did not say that.
- And check this out! - We got our own snacks! - My parents say I'm not allowed
to buy snacks at the theater.
So we're not buying anything at the theater.
- Nom noms! Feed me! - Hands off, Amethyst! These are for Connie and me to
share at the movie.
Speaking of which, how are we getting to the theater? It's kind of far.
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.
Today we're gonna travel in style.
Introducing the finest in luxury transportation Lion! Aw, you little goofball.
- You have a pet lion?! - Lion is sort of like a pet.
He does his own thing most of the time, though.
- See? Who knows where he got that? - Wow, Steven.
Everything in your life is so awesome and magical.
The most exciting thing in my life is tennis practice.
Forehand! Backhand! - Overhead death strike! - Whoa! Tennis is rad! Well, I
made up that last one.
I think Lion says we should hurry up and go.
Or maybe he was just yawning.
Anyway, let's go to the movie! And we're off! Uhh Lion, I want you to take us
to the movie.
Okay, you're not listening to me.
Lion isn't trained very well.
But I'm not trained very well either, so we're a Whoa! Whoa! Wait, Lion! Don't
go in the ocean! You can walk on water? Why don't you tell me you can do these
things you do?! Heyo! - Uh are you sure he knows where he's going? - Maybe it's
a short cut.
- Has he ever done this? - No, this is new! Whoa! - Are you okay? - That was
really cool.
Lion! Wait! Where are you going?! Oof! Whoa! Is this one of those magic gem
places that you've told me about? Yep.
Magic gem place.
Lion, normally I'm all about this stuff, but this is not the movies.
What does that mean, Lion? What does that even mean? What if he brought you
here for a reason? Well, maybe, but if we don't hurry, we're gonna miss the
commercials, and then we might miss the previews, and we still have to find the
perfect seats near the front but not too close.
- Hey.
I think it likes you! - Ah! - My hand's stuck! It won't come off! - Hang on!
Man, that's really stuck on good.
- I guess we'll have to chop it off.
- What?! - Hey, swords! - No! - Whoa! How'd you do that? - I don't know.
- Do it again! Do it again! - Um, okay.
- Anything? - No.
Here.
Ow! What are you hey! - What are you doing? - Maybe if I do this! Wait, I'm
ticklish.
Wait.
Stop.
Stop.
I'm gonna pee! Whoa.
Look at all this armor! - Press my nose.
Press my nose! - Boop! - Are those light cannons? - Next! Axes! Spiky chain
balls! A giant - Penny? - Does that mean its worth more than a regular penny?
Well, that would make "cents.
" This is so great, but I get the feeling, though, I'm not really supposed to
be here.
I want you here! I mean, I don't want you here.
I guess Lion wants us here.
But I want us to be at the movies! And I want to see lots of explosions.
- Should we be worried about this? - Uh Lion doesn't seem to be worried.
Run! - Connie! - Steven! Look out! Ah! Huh? Steven! What do we do?! Ah! Connie!
Ah! My bubble.
Lion! Get us out of here! Lion, please! What? Now you take us to the movies? -
Whoa! - Ah.
Connie, here.
I have something for that.
- Sorry.
They're not that cold.
- Thanks.
Well, we're here.
Shall we go in? That's okay.
L-let's just forget about it.
Huh? I-I'm sorry! Ugh! I ruined everything, didn't I? I don't know why you hang
out with me.
- I mess stuff up all the time.
- I don't know why you hang out with me! I'm so much more less interesting than
you! And obviously you have some sort of magical destiny.
Why would you even care about something like Dogcopter? Why?! Because it's
Dogcopter! He's a dog and a helicopter and a cop! He shoots missiles out his
butt, and he's gonna save the world! Dogcopter is very cool and important to
me.
Well, I'm no Dogcopter.
What the - Oh, no! - It's the robot shooty thing! How are we supposed to beat
it? Lion, what do we do? Uh this is weird, right? You have a sword in your
head?! Why don't you tell me you can do these things you do?! It came through!
Whoa! - What do I do with this?! - Watch out! Forehand! Backhand! Overhead
death strike! - Just like tennis practice.
- Magical destiny practice.
- Hi! - Uh, hello.
Two kids and one Lion to see "Dogcopter.
" Um, do you have a rewards card? Whoa! Was that in the book? Eh, they're
taking some liberties.

there! Are we engaged in a secret staring contest?! - Garnet! Are you okay? -
I'm fine.
- Hi, Steven.
- This place is wrecked! - Give me one down low.
- No accolades for you, Amethyst.
- She knocked the puffer fish back out into the ocean! - Narc! - Let's regroup
back at the temple.
- Where are you going? What about my sign? Steven! What is wrong with your
friends? One of them busts up my sign, then they all just jump into the sky
like some circus act without - even offering to help! - But, Mr.
Pizza! - Dad, pipe down! - Oh! Did I interrupt your beauty sleep? I don't need
sleep to look pretty.
- Now you listen here, young woman! - Kofi, you are going to wake this fish
from the dead with all the noise you're keeping.
Oh! Too late.
"Kofi, you so loud! Aaaaah!" Bleh.
Gunga, you're so funny.
Mom, quit joking around! Look what they did to my sign! - Cheese on bread! -
Can you believe it? You're such a nice boy, Steven.
- Why do you hang out with those animals? - They're not animals! They're the
Crystal Gems and they protect humanit I've heard enough! - Hey, girls, I think
I hear all of our cellphones ringing.
- Gunga, your hearing is so good.
Steven, you can tell your friends that they are officially - banned from Fish
Stew Pizza! - Wait! What?! Kofi, that's not fair! This was just an accident! -
What if we just, like, let it roam free? - That's not an option.
- Hey, Steven.
- I've got bad news, everyone.
- You've all been banned from Fish Stew Pizza.
- Oh! Uh, that's okay.
- That pizza wasn't even good.
- Aren't you guys upset about this? - Not at all.
- But these are our neighbors.
There's nothing we can do about that now.
Right now we have to figure out a way to take care of that puffer fish.
What's the point of saving people if they're just gonna ban you - from their
pizza shops? - We don't do it for thanks.
Yeah, see? That is so nice of you! The pizzas don't even know! If they got to
spend some time with you, they'd see how fun and smart and mysterious you are.
- Heh.
Mysterious.
- Hmm.
I know! I'll throw a little party on the beach in front of the temple! Just us
and the pizzas! I don't know, Steven.
I mean Don't worry! I'll take care of everything! Man, this is gonna be so
good! - Hey, Steven.
- Hey! - Got everything ready for your little party? - Yeah.
There's one more thing.
- What's this for? - I was thinking you guys could change your outfits.
- What's wrong with what we have on now? - Nothing! - I just thought it would
be nice to go kind of casual.
- Is this the right address? I've never seen this side of the beach before.
Oh, man, they're here.
Hurry up and change.
Over here, everyone! Hi! - Hey, Steven.
- Hello.
- How're you all doing today? - The shop is closed today - because it's broken.
- Uh uh, oh! That sounds, uh Hey, do I smell hot dogs? - Show me where the hot
dogs are.
- Oh! Right this way, everyone.
- First, let me introduce - We are the Crystal Gems! - # Garnet # - # Amethyst
# - # Pearl # - And Steven! But you already knew my name.
- Oh! You're all so talented! - So, you are a circus act.
- Circus act? - Hey, let's eat! - Everything came out great.
- Thanks, Kiki.
Aren't you girls hungry? You barely touched your food.
- We don't need to eat.
- Oh, you young people and your - experimental diets.
- I am much older than you.
- So, you all live in that tiny house up on that hill? - We inhabit the inner
sanctums only - accessible through magical extradimensional doors.
- What is wrong with your hand? - Why's this place look like it's falling
apart? - Well, the temple has - been here for thousands of years.
- Oh, I see how it is.
When something breaks around here, you just leave it alone, - just like the
sign at my shop! - Um Who wants to play volleyball? Okay, everyone, the court
is all set.
- Now to get into our teams.
- But, Steven, won't our - abilities give us an unfair advantage? - That's why
I'm picking the teams.
Amethyst and Jenny! Pearl and Kiki! Garnet and Kofi! and last but not least
yours truly and Nanefua! I haven't played in ages, but I bet I could whoop all
your butts.
That's the spirit.
You guys ready? Let's play! Hope you're ready to lose, Pearl! There's no way
I'd lose to someone like you! - Here we come! - Hyah! - Nice one, Kiki! - And
pow! - Amethyst, no kicking! - Psh! What kind of game is this? - Nicely done,
Kiki.
- Try and stick to the rules, Amethyst.
- Try harder, Jenny.
- Here it comes.
- Ugh! Come on, Jenny! - What? I'm not doing anything.
- Ha! My move! - Yes! - That was uncalled for, Amethyst.
- You afraid of gettin' a little sand - in your hair, Kiki? - No, just trying
to keep tidy.
There's nothing wrong with trying to keep tidy.
- So exciting! - Yeah! - Our turn.
- I'm ready.
- I got this one.
- Jennifer, you touch that ball, you're grounded! - Whoa! Daddy, you cheatin'!
- The look on your face! - This is going to be easy.
- It'd be nice if they stuck to the basics.
Take this, Garnet.
Hyah! Huuuur! Hyah! We should probably move, huh? - Yeah, we should.
- Oh! Oh, geez! - You're all running like wild chickens! - Whoa! Did you know
that when sand is superheated, it turns into glass? I did not know that.
- Whoa.
- Let's play! - Aah! - Whoo! - Amethyst! - Hyah! Over here, Amethyst.
Over here! - Kofi time! - Jenny time! - You can't use the car for a month! -
Daddy! - Why are you cheating so much? - You cheated first.
- That is not true.
- This is getting out of hand.
I'll run and get the ball.
Hey, why's it getting so windy?! Ah, no! It's back! - Puffer fish monster's
back! - What's all the - Nanefua, run! - We should win 'cause we're the best.
- Y'all cheated! - Cheaters! - You're out of line.
- Everyone is grounded here.
- Garnet! - Steven! - Oh, no! Gems, protect the Pizzas! - Hey! What is going
on?! This is terrible.
I was trying to get everyone together, - but now everyone's in danger.
- I'm not afraid of that thing.
Let's see if you can keep up with me! Of course I can! Over here! No! Over
here! Come on! Oh, my gosh! Steven! - What are they doing? - Everybody, get
ready! - Mom, you are crazy! - Not crazy.
Brave.
Gunga, careful with your back! - Amethyst, turn yourself into a ball! - Okay! -
Jenny, roll Amethyst to the net and then hold on! - Sure thing! - Pearl, head
over to Jenny and Amethyst! - Yes, ma'am! Hit Amethyst into the air as hard as
you can! With pleasure.
Kofi, Kiki, get over to the net.
Garnet, spike the beach! - I understand.
- Be gentle.
- I'll try.
- Yowch! - Here comes the tricky part.
- I'm ready! Everyone, take the net to the other side of the court.
Okay, everyone, pull the net into its face! - It's not enough! - Don't worry!
Here comes Garnet! - Thanks for your hospitality.
- And? And for saving my family.
You are all officially unbanned from my shop.
Aww! Thank you so much, Kofi! We really appreciate it, right, guys? - Okay.
Yes.
Thanks.
- Aaaand? - What were we banned from again? - Ehh.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e19 Episode Script ******
**** Rose's Room ****
1x19 - "Rose's Room" Steven: This is it, folks.
Rookie sensation Steven Universe readies his last spoonful of Kernel's classic
creamed corn.
As the crowd waits with bated breath, one bite between him and destiny.
[chomp!.]
[gulp!.]
And he's done it! He's eaten four cans of creamed corn! - Pearl: Good
afternoon, Steven.
- Steven: Guys, check this out! Amethyst: Stu-man in the house.
Whatcha got? Whatcha got? Steven: I got four empty cans of Colonel Kernel's
classic creamed corn.
- Garnet: Cool.
- Steven: Yeah.
And on the back are $5 coupons for mini golf.
I ate four cans so that we could all go together.
Pearl: That's so thoughtful, Steven.
Unfortunately, though, uh - Amethyst: We got to go on a mission.
- Steven: What? Not again! But you guys promised we'd hang out.
Garnet: A dangerous artifact has appeared in the Northern hemisphere.
- We need to go retrieve it.
- Steven: But mini golf is so much fun! There's castles and windmills and I
like it and Oh, look! Look what I brought.
I pulled out my Dad's old clubs and also found a pair of his old golf pants.
They're a little big on me, but you can wear them, Garnet.
[both chuckle.]
- Amethyst: See you, buddy.
- Pearl: We'll bring you something back.
Steven: Well, you're not the only ones with a dangerous adventure to tackle.
Oh, yeah! You received the mythril putter.
Doo-doo-doot-doot doot-doo! "Don't worry, professor, we're gonna sink 'em all!"
[chuckles.]
Uh-oh! Oh, windmill, why must we always fight? - Par! - Steven: Man, it would
have been just like this.
[beeping.]
[beeping continues.]
Steven: "I can't lose! I am the greatest golfer in the universe!" [mimics
explosions.]
[laughs.]
All right! - Secret ending! - Pearl: Hey, Steven.
We're back.
- Steven: Hey.
- Project F.
L.
O.
G.
? That's "golf" backwards.
- What is this? - Amethyst: Hey, Steven.
- Want to hear about where we've been? - Steven: Uh, oh wait! Wait! Hold on.
June 9, 2014? But that was the day he disappeared - Steven: Hey! - Garnet:
Steven, look at this.
- Amethyst: It's the wailing stone we found.
- Garnet: The wailing stone I found.
Pearl: Isn't it neat? It uses high-frequency sound waves - Steven: Guys -
Pearl: with a message relay between - two fixed points - Amethyst: You just
have to push this! [whir!, screech!.]
[pop!.]
Pearl: Amethyst, I told you - not to turn it on in the house.
- Amethyst: [laughs.]
Chill out, P.
It's not like anyone got hurt, and Steven loved it.
Steven? Steven: That was the secret ending! Now I have to replay the final
dungeon all over again.
It's not fair! I can't go mini golfing, I can't play my game, I can't stop
going to the bathroom 'cause I ate all that creamed corn.
So much corn.
[sighs.]
I just wish I had a place for myself.
[humming.]
Huh? My gem! [humming intensifies.]
Pearl: Rose's door.
Steven, your gem is opening your mother's room.
- Steven: Whoa.
- Pearl: Steven, wait! - Garnet: Steven, don't go in there! - Steven: It's
never about what I want to do, is it? Well, now I have a place where I'm going,
and you can't come! - All: Steven! - Steven: [panting.]
Yes! Whoa.
So, this is my Mom's room? She must have liked clouds a lot.
But what kind of room doesn't even have a bed? Aah! Cool.
Hmm.
This bed is pretty nice, but you know what would be really nice? Quadruple bunk
beds! [gasps.]
With a slide.
Whoo-hoo! A parachute! [laughs.]
What next? Hmm.
Um A tiny floating whale? [whale sings.]
Steven: [giggles.]
Wow.
Here I get anything I ask for.
But you know what I really want? I want to see the end of my game without being
interrupted.
It's me, your father.
After decades of cryo-stasis, I'm finally free.
Saving the day is just par for the course.
Steven: Awesome.
[yawns.]
Hmm.
Kind of hungry now.
[laughs.]
All right.
Wha? Hey! I want a real doughnut.
What?! Can you believe this? [whale sings.]
Now I have to go out for doughnuts.
Steven: Don't get excited, guys.
I'm only back for a second.
Well good.
I didn't want to see you anyway.
Steven: Hey! How's my favorite fine-foods franchise? So, I'm thinking double-
chocolate cinnamon twist with sprinkles on the side.
You know I like to dip.
Uh Steven to Sadie and Lars.
- Is this, like, a joke or something? - Together: Hello, Steven.
- What kind of doughnut would you like? - Steven: Uh, I just said - Together:
It's very nice to see you, Steven.
- Steven: Well, it's very nice - to see you, too.
- Together: Here are your doughnuts.
- Steven: Wait.
You guys, I only ordered - Together: Okay.
- We love you, Steven.
Bye-bye now.
- Steven: Wait! Where are you guys going? I still haven't paid for these.
You guys, hold on a sec.
Huh? Hey, Onion! Have you seen Lars and Sadie? They should have just been out
here.
Hey, if you see them, let me know, okay? Here.
Have a doughnut.
I'll leave it here for you.
See you later.
All the lights are on, but no one's here.
Pee dee? Oh.
Fry bits.
Usually I'm all about the bits, but I'm feeling kind of spooked right now.
Gah! Uh, you know what? I think I'm gonna go look around some more.
See you later, Frybo.
Aah! [breathing heavily.]
Connie! I can't believe it's you.
When did you get back in town? Huh? Aah! The water! Connie, what's happening?
Where is everyone? - He was incredible! - Steven: Uh? He was incredible! He was
incredible! - Steven: Wh-wh-what? - He was incredible! Steven: Get me out of
here! What's wrong with your faces? Lion, you too?! [gasps.]
Can someone please explain this?! Huh! [exclaims.]
[thud!.]
- Steven! - Steven: Dad? Is that you? What? Of course.
Are you doing all right? You look like you saw a ghost.
Either that or you stayed - up all night playing a video game.
- Steven: Dad, I'm freaking out.
I feel like I'm stuck inside of some crazy dream.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't we share some of those doughnuts and you can tell me about this crazy
night you're having? [chomp!.]
Steven: The gems were trying to tell me something about Mom's room.
But I was so mad I didn't listen.
They're always leaving me behind, and - I guess I wanted to do it to them, too.
- That's not so bad.
Everyone needs some alone time now and then.
[mimics guitar riff.]
[chomp!.]
Steven: [chuckles.]
Yeah, it was really fun for a while.
But now, the whole city everyone and everything is - acting really weird.
- Well, the important thing is you told the truth.
Yeah I guess I did.
[mimics guitar riff.]
[chomp!.]
Steven: Uh, Dad? Your advice is making less sense than usual.
Well, the important thing is family and friendship, honesty, values, and no one
got arrested.
[mimics guitar riff.]
[chomp!.]
Steven: Aah! I'm still in the room! All of this it's all a fake-a-roo! [mimics
guitar riff.]
[gasps.]
Aah! This is all wrong! Huh? Aah! [breathing heavily.]
[exclaims.]
[breathing heavily.]
Aaaaah! - I don't want this.
- What do you want, Steven? Steven: I want to be back with the gems.
[grunts.]
[gasps.]
Garnet! [chomp!.]
- Garnet: Ow.
- Steven: You're not clouds! - Amethyst: All right, Steven! [chomps!.]
- Pearl: [exclaims.]
Steven: Guys, it was awful.
I was trapped in a messed-up version of Beach City.
- Everyone was acting super weird and - Amethyst: You had Rose's room - build
the whole town?! - Pearl: It can't handle a task like that.
- Thank goodness you're okay.
- Steven: [sighs.]
I'm sorry I got mad, guys.
I get it now.
Things can't always go exactly how I want.
- Pearl: Oh, Steven, we're sorry, too.
- Amethyst: Mm-hmm.
Garnet: But guess what.
We have time to hang out now.
[gasps.]
Steven: I always get what I want!

**** Coach Steven ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x20 -
"Coach Steven" Whoa! What magical place of mysteries is this? - Well - Oh, I'm
so glad you asked.
This was once a communication hub for gem kind.
But lately, it's begun transmitting bursts - of electromagnetic interference.
- What's that mean? - It's hurting television.
- No! I'll save you, television! Sorry, but we need a Steven at least this
strong for this job.
It's all the me I could be! Amethyst, we could be here all day taking out each
of these pillars individually.
Ugh, I hate it when you're right.
You get this look on your face.
- Yeah, that's the one.
- What we need is a - well-thought-out plan.
- No.
What we need is Sugilite.
- Amethyst, fuse with me.
- What?! Yeah! Let's mash it up! - Bigger! Badder! Better! - Hold your horses!
Are you guys going to become a gem fusion? Wait! Garnet, think about this.
You and Amethyst can be a little unstable when your personalities combine.
We need to be careful.
Fuse with me instead.
We don't need to be careful.
We just need to be huge.
- Oh, yeah! Let's wreck this joint! What what Pearl, come on.
I want to see.
I forgot how great it feels to be me.
- That's Sugilite? - You got it, baby.
- Hey, Steven, want to see something cool? - Yeah! - You like that, little man?
- Are you gonna smash - stuff with your wrecking-ball thingy? - That's the
plan.
- Where should I start? - Do that one! - Steven, I think we should go.
- No way! This is awesome! Watch it! Steven! You're just too much! Maybe you're
just too little! - Steven, we're going.
- What?! I'm fine! What about Sugilite? - She can find her own way home.
- Aw.
- 'Sup? - Whoa, Steven! - What happened to you? - Oh, just a little battle
damage - from our last mission.
- Really? - Like what? - I got hit by a rock! It must not have been a very big
rock.
Well, there's internal bleeding.
My hurt is on the inside! - Oh, okay.
- Toughen up, Steven.
- You're right.
I'm soft.
- If I weren't so modest, I'd whip out my sweet six-pack and show you what a
real man looks like.
Yeah, I'm not gonna say thanks.
That's it! We all need a workout.
Let's do it.
Let's work out together.
You could beat up Lars, and you don't have to starve to death if Sadie divorces
you.
- We're not married.
- And I know just the guy to help us out.
Wow, this looks great.
- Wha what? - Hey, dad.
Hey, Steven.
You like it? It's the best I could do on such short notice.
- No kidding.
- Well, I might join you kids, show you how it's done.
I've been slacking on my workout routine for a few weeks months years.
- Decades.
- Sure.
The more the meatier! Oh! We'll need sweatbands.
Hey, Pearl.
Come to check out some buff studs? No.
- Steven, what on Earth are you up to? - We're starting a gym.
I'ma get supa-strong! Like Sugilite! - You know, maybe this isn't a good idea.
- What? I want to be strong - so I can be useful to the team.
- There are different - ways of being strong.
- But I want to be strong in the real way.
- Come on, Pearl.
Let's get beefy! - I'd rather not.
Steven.
Why do you have to look up to her? aside from in a literal sense don't you know
that a power that big comes with a bigger expense? and can't you see that she's
out of control and overzealous I'm telling you for your own good and not
because I'm I could show you how to be strong in the real way and I know that
we can be strong in the real way and I want to inspire you I want to be your
rock and when I talk, it lights a fire in you Who's ready to get buff?! I don't
want to see your gut! I want to see your guts! I can show you how to be strong
in the real way and I know that we can be strong in the real way and I want to
inspire you I want to be your rock # and when I talk, it lights a fire in you #
I want to inspire you I want to be your rock and when I talk, it lights a fire
in you Hey, Steven, maybe, um, - you could work out a bit, too.
- Huh? I've been.
We've been working out.
You've just been singing some dumb song.
- But you're doing a great job pumping us up.
- Thanks, but I need to get strong, too.
I'm switching to four-wheel drive.
Steven, come on! We're ready to get started.
We can't work out without your mad coaching skills! Be there in a sec! So sore
from getting ripped.
I don't understand.
Amethyst and Garnet still aren't back yet.
I tried to warp back to check on them, but the warp pad is down.
- What's that out in the water? - Are you seeing this, too? - Wha - Wha What
the hey is that? - I'm bored! - It's Sugilite! - Y-You're back! - You left me
behind.
We just thought you didn't need any help.
Now, why don't you separate, and we can all - sit down and relax? - No! -
Pearl! - Listen to me.
You've been fused for too long.
You're losing yourselves.
I am myself, and I'm sick of being split up! So you better get used to me,
baby, and get this - junk off my beach! - Why is she wrecking dad's gym? - Why
is she attacking you? - Steven, get out of here.
I can't move.
- What? You want to fight? - You'll thank me later! - Come on, kid! - Dad, no!
Pearl! You think you're something? You ain't nothing! My muscles.
Steven! I'm sorry, Steven Garnet, Amethyst.
I wasn't strong enough to protect you.
- I'm not strong enough to do anything.
- Come on, Pearl! Don't give up! - I know you can take her down! - I can't.
Yes, you can! Come on.
You always know what to do! You've got to show her what you showed me that
you're strong, Pearl strong in the real way! - What?! You want some more?! -
Anytime! You're no match for me! Not even close! - Go! - Get back here! Nice
try.
Is that all you got? You think that's enough to beat ugh! - Amethyst! Garnet!
Are you okay? - Yeah.
Sugilite just overworked our bodies.
It's a little painful.
And I've got a monster headache.
- Oh.
Whoops.
- Pearl, you did it! Thanks.
You make a good coach.
Pearl we should have listened.
You were right.
- Yeah.
I was right.
- Go, Pearl! Come on! I feel great! Who's up for a mission? How long is she
going to keep this up? We deserve it.
Take it like a gem.
- Uh, what the heck just happened? - Drop and give me 20!

Sometimes I sleep on the napkins - when I get tired.
- Steven: Is that why they're called nap-kins? Not really, no.
Good joke, though.
On breaks, we chill out here.
We can even watch tv! Sometimes, Lars will cover for me so I can watch "canine
court.
" And now, most important of all, this is where we store the donuts.
They're mailed in from some corporate bake-station.
- Steven: You mean you don't make them here? - No, not since the accident.
Now, Steven, this job is a big responsibility, so you're gonna - have to watch
this videotape.
- Steven: What is it? It's like a dvd shaped like a box, and it'll tell you
everything you need to know.
[retro pop music playing.]
Steven: Mr.
Smiley used to work here? No, but he used to be an actor/R&B singer.
Donuts at the big donut they make the world go round, A treat when you are down
Donuts Wow! at the big donut Bam! dunk them in coffee or tea, napkins are
always free now, if a customer chokes on a donut that ain't right.
state law requires that you assist them help 'em out, now.
take both hands, push below the diaphragm get them happy and breathing as fast
as you can That's the law.
in the event of a fire don't panic.
Stay calm.
there is a fire extinguisher against the back wall there is a 6% sales tax on
edible goods 'cause tax exemption is for non-prepared foods in coffee or tea,
napkins are always free [echoing.]
# free, free # Steven: That was great! Are all videotapes that informative? In
my experience, yeah.
It started out as just a summer job, but that was two summers ago.
Hmm.
I'll have a [gasps.]
- # Donuts, at the big donut # - Hey! Both: # they make the world go round #
[chuckles.]
Steven: Wow.
I can't believe you used - to be a real actor/R&B singer.
- "Used to be"? - [mumbling.]
Kids, they don't know anything.
- Wow, I'm impressed! [door dings.]
Last time someone mentioned that song, we couldn't get Mr.
Smiley to go home.
Steven: # to perk up, you gotta percolate # a hot cup of coffee makes the
perfect date [chuckling.]
Aww, thanks! Maybe I should phone up Lars, tell him he can stay home 'cause I
found his replacement! [laughs.]
- Steven: Really?! - Oh.
No, th-that was a joke.
Steven: I know we both love Lars but this job is the best thing that's ever
happened to - me, and we should fire Lars.
- We can't "fire Lars.
" [sighs.]
- Why not? - Well, you know, I mean, he may do things like come in late and
leave all the really hard work for me, but look, I like Lars! He he's a nice
guy Once you get to know him.
[chuckles.]
There was this one time the new "army of war" game was coming out.
But Lars was banned from the only place selling it.
[laughs.]
He wanted it so bad! So who does he beg to stand in line for seven hours? Me!
[chuckles.]
I didn't think much of it.
When I got to his house, I saw he cleaned up his room a little, and he got a
big box of oyster crackers.
They're my favorite.
[chuckles.]
He let me be his "player 2," and - we spent the whole night together.
- Steven: That really is nice.
- Must've been one great video game! - Yeah, it was.
Steven: Maybe we could do something nice for Lars.
Donuts, d-d-donuts donuts, donuts, donuts, donuts, donuts, donuts I-I thought
you wanted this to be a surprise! - He would hear us a mile away! - Steven: But
the donut fever's fried my soul! Aah! [laughs.]
Huh? Aw, he already ordered pizza! [laughing.]
[laughter.]
Both: Huh? - Do a flip! - Oh, yeah! [panting.]
Hey, Lars, thanks for inviting us over.
It's no problem [laughs.]
'cause I got the whole day off by faking a severe back injury! [Laughter.]
Steven: Ugh! He was faking this whole Uh, don't worry! We can handle the big
donut! Who needs crummy, old Lars? [crying.]
Steven, he's made a fool of me! Idiot! [crying.]
He's burned me before.
Just once, I'd like to burn him back! Steven: I know how to burn people! Wait
right here.
Actually, this might take a while.
You'd better go home.
See you tomorrow at wo-o-o-rk! [dog panting.]
[dogs barking.]
- Steven: Fire salt! - Huh? Steven: Burn! Burn people! You know we can't add
anything to the donuts! Steven: It's just a little fire salt.
I was going to prank Lars.
He did really hurt my feelings a little.
But what kind of person does that make you if you try to hurt him back? Steven:
A hero? [door dings.]
[groaning.]
My back! Sadie, I finally got out of bed, but I don't think I can work today
either.
Sadie, don't make me walk all the way to the break room! [hissing.]
Steven: Sadie This is gonna be so funny! Yo, Sadie, where you at? Are you
slacking off? - [monotone.]
Lars.
- Steven: Hi, Lars! - Why is Steven in a donut suit? - Don't worry about that.
- How's your back? - Uh, actually, it still hurts like - Really.
- No, no, it's cool.
I know I can - count on you to help, "P" 2.
- Sure.
Just relax.
In fact - Why don't you have a donut? [sizzling.]
- Yeah, all right.
Careful.
It's a little hot.
[snickering.]
Hey, this is pretty good.
This a new flavor or something? [laughing.]
She said she said it's hot! [rumble!.]
[screaming.]
- Steven, help Lars! - Steven: Uh, Lars, drink this! [whistle!.]
- Aah! [groans.]
- No! Lars, come back! [smoke alarm beeping.]
- Steven, I didn't want this! - Steven: I know how to fix this! We just need to
get Lars to calm down.
- How are we gonna find him?! - Aah! Steven: I think he went this way! And of
the many treasures in our wonderful city, this is certainly one of the
sweetest.
As mayor, I'm proud to unveil this the largest bowl of ice cream in Beach
County! [crowd gasping.]
Yes, let's all scream for ice cream.
Aah! [splat.]
[muffled screaming.]
[crowd gasps.]
[continues screaming.]
Yeah.
It melted, Gary! Well, you should have said that at the meeting! [screaming.]
- Steven: Amethyst! - Amethyst: Hey, why's donut guy breathing fire? Steven: I
tried to prank Lars, but I used too much fire salt! Amethyst: Steven That's
hilarious.
You did this to me? [yelling.]
[laughing.]
[flames roaring.]
It wasn't Steven! - It was me.
- Amethyst: Oh, now it's gettin' good! [Steven panting.]
After all I do for you, you lie to me so you can sneak off - with some other
girl?! - Steven: And other boys! [gasps, whimpers.]
[crying.]
That night we played video games, I don't know what it meant to you, but ever
since then, I can't get the thought out of my head that you're a good person.
That night I really thought "player 2" is that just your way of saying I could
- have been anyone? - Sadi [coughing.]
Steven: # if a customer chokes on a donut # state law requires that you assist
them take both hands, push below the diaphragm [retches.]
Steven: Another day saved by Steven Universe, with the bonus musical stylings
of Harold Smiley.
You're welcome! - I'm not apologizing.
- Uh, no! [wheezes.]
I want to help! - But I get it if you want to be alone.
- Oh, no, no, no! Stay.
I-I mean, you can help.
But first, let's get you some water, and maybe get you out of those burnt
shirts.
Amethyst: Hey, we make a pretty great team.
[chomping.]
Steven: You were absolutely no help whatsoever.
Amethyst: Eh.

"Steven and the Stevens" - Hey! How 'bout this one here?! - What one? This
little one! It's adorb-able.
Steven, the legendary glass of time won't be nearly so small and insignificant.
It'll be beautiful and grand, like this one! - I think it's this one.
- Whoa! You mean the biggest one?! How are we even supposed to get that back to
the warp pad? - I can carry it.
- Wait! We need to be careful which one we touch! You remember what happened
last time we were here.
- What happened? - Hey, guys! I'm makin' the call, and it's this janky one
here! Amethyst! Uh Nope, it wasn't.
- Look out! - Whoa! Ugh! We don't have much time! - Amethyst, come on! -
Steven! W-Where do you think you're going?! Amethyst gets to keep hers! - Darn
tootin'! - I'm gonna get the one I picked out! - Steven! - Steven! My name's
Steven.
- You're gonna live with me.
- Steven, come on! I'm a-comin'! I'm a-comin'! Hang on.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
- Gotcha.
Well done, Garnet! Hot potato! - We're doing that again, right?! -
Unfortunately, we'll have to wait another hundred years for the sea shrine to
reform 'cause somebody couldn't keep their hands to themselves.
You have a lobster on your butt.
Huh? Eee! Beach-a-palooza! - Beach-a-wha-whozaa? - Palooza.
That was a lot of fun, you guys.
I'll see you later! After you, sir.
Buh-bye! Yep.
- Mm-hmm.
- Dad! Dad! Are you ready to rehearse? Whoa! Uhh We're having a bit of a day.
- Is it stuck? - Yeah.
Why does a boat need a car wash? Huh! Sorry, buddy.
I don't think I can play in the concert tonight.
I got to deal with this.
You're bailing on beach-a-palooza?! - But the whole town's gonna be there! -
Steven, that's like 15 people.
Next time, bud, I promise.
All right, maybe if you bring it - forward a little bit.
- Stupid boat gettin' all stuck.
Nobody likes you, boat! Wish I could've been there to tell my dad you were too
fat! That's it.
Just back her in.
- She'll definitely fit.
- What the - Dad! Dad! - Hey, Stu-ball.
- You excited for beach-a-palooza! - Dad! Dad! Fat, it's fat! Fat, fat, fat! -
Rude! - Not you! The boat! - The boat! - Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Stop! - Huh?
Nice catch, Steven! The thing! You took me back in time, didn't you?! Oh, man.
Pearl's gonna flip when she finds out you were the real one! Look, I'm sorry,
but the boat's fat! Oh, no! Your truck! Oh! Whoa! Gotta save the van! I wish I
could go back and stop myself from stopping my dad! That's it.
Just back her in.
- She'll definitely fit.
- What the Dad! Dad! What? - Shh! - Future Steven? Listen, two-minutes-ago
Steven.
We can't go around trying to change time stuff.
It just makes things worse! - Oh, no! How did this happen?! - Aww, man.
I really wanted to play at beach-a-palooza! Too bad you and I can't be in a
band.
Wait a minute! Steven! Steven? Steven? What's going on? - No time to explain! -
Wanna join our band?! Yes! But didn't dad say he would play with us? He had an
emergency at the car wash.
- We should go help him! - No! There's nothing we can do.
The boat's fat, trust us.
Okay, so, who's our fourth? - We need a drummer.
- Not a problem, Steven.
Hey, it's the time thing "Steven and the Stevens" can't you see it in my eyes?
I'm the one, I'm the one - 2! - 3! - 4! - # I'm not like the other guys # - #
he's not like anybody # - # ahh, ahh # well, that's not completely right
there's a few that I'm just like Steven and the Stevens - # ahh, ahh, ahh # - #
we're gonna make you smile # me, myself, and I, and him - # are all the same
guy # - # Steven and the Stevens # come on, now, don't Be shy me, myself and I
and him - That's me! - # are all the same guy # Hey! Great singing, Steven! -
Thanks, Steven! - Can I sing lead this time? Well, I usually sing lead vocals
when I play with dad.
- So do I! - Me, too! Me, too, too! We all do! We're all Steven! Well, one of
us has got to be the band leader! - Hmm.
- Hmm.
Oh! The leader should be the original Steven! - The one that's been around the
longest! - Yeah! All right! - That's a good idea! - Oh, ho, ho! - Mh-mm.
Done and done! Steven 2, you're the smart one.
Steven 3, you're the funny one.
Steven 4, you're the sensitive one.
And I'm the handsome one! Okay? - Okay! - Okey-dokey, artichokey! Steven 4,
what are you doing?! You're not the funny one! - Steven 3 is! - Well, we're all
the same person, so we're all equally prone - to being hilarious.
- No, no! That was too smart an observation for you, 3! You're the funny one! -
Wait, which one am I again? - Dang it, number 2, - you're the smart one! - Hey,
if Steven 1 is the handsome one, does that mean the rest of us - aren't good-
looking? - No way! - We're all extremely attractive! - Let's go get jobs as
models! Hey! None of you are the handsome one! I'm the handsome one! Ah! No! I
didn't mean we decided Let's take five.
- There's a 5th Steven? - No! I mean a five-minute break! We know.
I can't believe it.
I'm so annoying! Maybe it's time for me to quit the music business.
Steven! Ste-Ste-Ste Steven! Ste-Ste-Ste Steven! - # Ste-Ste-Ste Steven! # -
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - What's all this noise?! - # Ste-Ste-Ste # I thought we
agreed that Steven and the Stevens was gonna be a light-hearted throwback to
early rock 'n' roll, not this mess of screaming and distortion! Look, Steven.
Steven and I were talking, and Steven agrees.
- Your attitude just isn't working for us.
- We've been a lot - more productive without you.
- We already wrote an angsty song about that time you made us feel bad - for
not being handsome.
- You're kicking me out of the band?! Wait.
Who's playing drums? Amethyst said she'd do it.
- I'm down for whatever.
- Oh, come on! Steven's a big, fat meanie a big fat meanie zucchini - Whoa,
dude.
- Listen up! You can't kick me out of the band! I'm the original Steven.
I created you! Steven and the Stevens was my idea! Without me, you'd all be
nothing! That's it.
Steven, no! Wish I could have been there to tell my dad you were too Don't
start the band, Steven.
It'll only tear us apart.
Ho, ho! We all have time things! You'll never catch me, you turkeys! Ha! We got
to stop me.
I'm okay, guys.
I just wha Too far back! Huh? Just take me back to the beginning.
Amethyst gets to keep hers! - Darn tootin'! - I'm gonna get the one I picked
out! - Steven! - Steven! My name's Steven.
Stop right there! - Give me the time thing, Steven.
- Wait.
Are you future me? Just hurry up and give it! Huh? Wha Don't make me hurt me,
Steven.
Why do you need it so bad? Just give it to me! Give it up, Steven! I know
everything you're gonna do before you do it! Huh? Uh Stop it! Huh? What? - Huh?
- Look around you.
This isn't right.
When Steven fights Steven, who is the winner? What have we become? - What is
it? - What's wrong with us? - What have we become? - We're not the Stevens we
once were.
And to fix that, I have to end it! Steven, please! You got to Steven, dad can't
play beach-a-palooza with you.
The boat's fat.
You got to find another way.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stay cool forever, Steven.
Mwah.
Arrivederci.
can't you see it in our eyes? - # we're the one, we're the one # - # two # - #
three # - # four # we're not like the other guys we're not like anybody - # ahh
# - # by the way, don't go back in time # - # ahh # - # or you'll destroy
yourself # Steven and the Crystal Gems we're gonna make you smile I

Uh Hi.
Aw, it's okay.

Just relax.

That's it.
Doesn't relaxing feel nice? You want to come over here and relax with me? Yeah,

Yeah.
Don't be shy.
We can be friends.
- My name's Steven.

terrible idea.
And he's even managed to pop a bubble and let out that awful thing! If that
thing hurt you, so help me, I'll No! It didn't do anything! Garnet! Don't hurt
it! I accidentally let it out of its bubble, but it didn't even try to hurt me.
It's not like the other monsters.
It's just scared and confused.
Please, Garnet, I'm begging you.
I can't say no to that face.
Excuse me?! You can't be serious! I think you should try and tame it, Steven.
Garnet, thank you so much! Hmmm.
Shut down by the G-squad! Well, let's at least take some precaution.
All right, Steven, let's see if you can get it - to calm down.
- UmIt still seems a little scared.
Maybe you guys could put your weapons - away and watch from the house? -
Absolutely not! Steven can handle this.
- Garnet! - Pearl.
Oh! You just got Garneted! Okay, friend, it's just us now.
Calmy calm.
Calm.
Just like before.
Yeah.
Just relax and let your hair down.
You want to come over here? Huh? Don't worry.
It won't be like before.
How about we try something else? Hmm Oh! What's this? Chiiiiips? You like
chiiips? You want a chiiips? Yeah? Yeah? Aw, look at this chiiiip.
Yum, yum, yum! Mmmm! Tasty, tasty! Hmm? Try it.
That's it.
Smells good, right? I don't know how you eat with an eyeball in your mouth, but
I'm glad you like it.
Hmm? Hmmm? Huh? Whoo-hoo! Hey, come on! You love chips and I love chips Yeah!
Shoo! Get! Those aren't for you! Huh? W-What are you doing? You saved me.
But we have to go back for the Shooting Star.
Garnet! Pearl! - Amethyst! - Whoa! Why isn't that thing on its rock? I trained
her up.
Look! Squaaawk! Squawk! - Squawk! - Steven, you can't just that was awes -
Whooo! - No! Mi torta! Steven, this is unacceptable.
Aw, come on, Pearl.
She can help us on, like, - missions and stuff.
- Oh, no.
- Out of the question.
- Aww.
Well, we can't return to the ice cavern now.
We have to stay and deal with - Steven and his situation.
- Well, I don't know how we're gonna get through all those ice boulders without
- causing a cave-in anyway.
- Hmm.
That's how.
- I just don't know if this will work.
- Squawk! All right, Centipeetle! Shooting Star, here we come.
Whoa.
Squawk! Squawk! - Whoa! - Oh, my.
- Whoa.
- Cool! There it is the Shooting Star! An ancient elemental so hot and so
volatile, it can only be contained in ice.
- Bare skin cannot endure its intensity.
- What do you do - wih a Shooting Star? - Uh, you shoot it.
Garnet, you'll need to use your gauntlets so as not to hurt your hands.
No! No, no! Not now! Something's wrong.
Whoa! Steven! I knew this would happen! Pearl, stop! It was an accident! -
Sorry for pulling.
- Steven! No! Stop! You don't need to fight! This isn't you.
You're not a monster anymore.
You're more than that.
We have so many memories now.
Remember the chip times? And how you saved me from that vicious seagull? And
how we became best friends? You have to remember! This all happened today! Huh?
Nooooo! Nooo! - You saved me.
- Steven, you did a good job training the Centipeetle.
Your mother would be so proud.
- She would? - The truth is, Rose Quartz had tried to use her powers to save
these monsters, too, but she was never able to heal them.
Never? But if she couldn't do it Who knows? Maybe when you have better control
of your powers, you might help them in ways - even your mother couldn't.
- Even this one.
I'll keep it safe.
- Wow! - Steven! You can bubble gems! Wow.
Wait for me, Centipeetle.
I promise I'll heal you up someday.
Ooh! Wait!

**** An Indirect Kiss ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x24 - "An
Indirect Kiss" Steven, hurry up! Are you okay? - I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're okay? Yeah.
Okay.
Uh, so, um Is this fence new? Eh it's a long story.
- Is it a magic story?! - M-M-M-a-a-a-ybe? Well, what happened?! Tell me.
Please? Okay, okay.
But it's not a happy story.
Amethyst was horsing around by the cliff.
Amethyst, be careful! Steven, why you getting so worked up? What do you care
about me or something? - Yes! - Aw, Steven, I didn't mean to make you whoa-a-a-
a-a-a! Amethyst, stop! You're gonna fall! Ooh! Steven, I'm - gonna fa-a-ll! -
Amethyst, you're - gonna get hurt! - Steven, please.
I'm a gem warrior.
I'm not gonna fa Ugh.
This is so embarrassing.
I'm okay! So, I ran down there as fast as I could.
- Are you sure you're okay? - Yes, Steven.
I'm fine, except for this! - Amethyst! - Great.
- Show me your gem! - Fresh! Amethyst, your gem is cracked! Rude! It's not a
big deal! Plus, now I have this cool googly eye! How did this happen? She fell
off the cliff by the lighthouse.
- Did not! - Of course.
How could I have been so blind? We need to put a fence up there - so this will
never happen again! - And that's why there's a fence.
The end.
- Wait, what happened to Amethyst? - Uh - Come on.
Tell me the rest! - I don't wanna.
Steven? Steven - Mm - Steven! Okay, okay! But only if you let me try on your
glasses.
Only if you give me the rest of your juice.
Okay, but it's mostly backwash.
- Good enough.
- How do I look? - I have no idea.
- Well, um, so Uh, we were all worried about Amethyst.
So, what's the problem? - Amethyst falls on stuff all the time.
- It'd be fine if it was just her body, but her gem is damaged.
So what do you do to fix it? Before we had Rose.
Steven, your mother had healing tears that flowed from her gem.
She felt real love for those around her.
She felt real sorrow when they were hurt.
You have the Rose Quartz gem now.
- I know that power is in you, too.
- Amethyst, show me your gem! Yeah, all right.
The power to heal.
It's not working.
I guess I'm just too tough to cry.
Just today, you were crying about snakes.
- They don't have any arms! - We have no choice.
We need to take Amethyst to Rose's healing spring.
Guys, I'm fine.
I'm not gonna get any wor-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r _ And in
the center of the garden Rose's fountain, overflowing with your mother's
healing, lachrymal essence! - I don't see it.
- Wha _ Now, now! Uh, let's keep it together! Our memories of Rose can't be
tainted by some overgrown brambles! Look at them.
They're a mess without her guidance.
Directionless, pathetic, clinging things.
- It's going to be okay, Garnet.
- Sure.
Y-Y-You really think so? Healing tears! Hmm.
Maybe there's a path over here! _ Pain can make one cry.
Where is pain? Amethyst, no more roughhousing! You'll exacerbate your crack! _
Aw, right in the gem.
_ Ohh! Oh! Keep calm.
What we need to do is get you Into the fountain immediately, if we can ever
find the way - under all this mess! - Shh.
I needed that.
This way.
We could've probably gotten in without hurtling a giant rock into Rose's most
precious sanctuary! But if you're okay with it, I'm fine, too! This isn't
right.
- The fountain isn't running.
- What? - W-What's wrong with it? - I'm not sure.
Is that mom? Oh, oh, I'm getting emotional! I think it's happening! Uh, I'm
really feeling it! Headache! So give back my glasses and finish the story! Ah,
come on! I had it! Steven, it's fine.
Just just stay here and watch Amethyst.
We'll find out what's wrong with the fountain.
No, no.
Wait! I can still do it! Wait, wait! It might still happen! Guys? _ I can't
understand you! I don't understand anything! Why is everyone acting so strange?
Why can't I why can't I cry?! Why can't I cry? It's just I mean, I don't know
how to feel about you, but everybody else does.
I wish I could have met you.
Then this place could make me sad, and I could cry healing tears, like you.
Are you okay? Keep going.
Amethyst, Where's your gem? Amethyst, I'm sorry! I can't do anything right.
Now I'm going to lose you, and it's all my fault.
Ha, ha.
You care about me.
Please let me be a magic healer.
Oh, come on! Look at this guy, saving my life and junk.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Did you see what I did? It was magic! My tears brought the fountain back to
life and saved Amethyst! I'm pretty sure Garnet and I unplugging a clogged
chamber brought the fountain back to life.
- We saved Amethyst.
- You don't think my crying was a little related to that? Oh, Steven, you don't
have healing tears.
You'll never have any real magic powers, and we don't want - anything more to
do with you.
- She didn't really say that.
No, but that's what it felt like.
Is that why you've been so down? Oh.
You can have your juice back.
Nah, that's okay.
Everyone expects me to be like my mom.
What if I never get those powers? Then you'll be like me.
That's not so bad.
But if I don't have powers, then I can't hang out with Amethyst or Garnet or
Pearl, and I-I can't - go on missions! - You don't need any powers to be here
with me.
Ow.
Ugh.
- What's wrong? - I think There's just there's something wrong with my glasses.
My My eyes.
I-I-I can see! - What? - I can see without my glasses! Did I heal your eyes?
But how? The juice box! I don't have healing tears! I have healing spit! What
am I going to tell my parents? What am I going to tell my optometrist?! I don't
even know! Oh, thank you, Connie! Lion, let's go tell the gems! They're never
gonna believe this!

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e25 Episode Script ******
**** Mirror Gem ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x24 -
"Mirror Gem" - What? Why not? - Steven, I told you I can't hang out today.
I have tennis practice.
And then mom wants to go out for a family dinner.
But she said I could hang out all day tomorrow and I can come Over all the time
now that it's summer vacation.
What's summer vacation? You know, when school gets out for the summer? I've
never been to this how do you say? School? How does it work? It's a place where
you go to learn.
- It's full of desks, chalkboards - Hmm.
- books, maps.
- I see.
- Yep, it's all coming together.
- So, how do we - begin our "school"? - Uh I I don't know.
This is everything Connie told me.
Why do I never ask follow-up questions?! Who will teach little Stevie now?!
Teach you?! Steven, if only I had known that's what you really wanted.
Twooow! Haaaaaaa! We found this gem-powered mirror at the galaxy warp.
It can capture and display any event it's witnessed in all of gem history.
It'll offer you everything you've ever wanted to know about your fellow gems
and our culture.
I must be incredibly important to gem culture.
It's just you in there.
It hasn't even been activated.
Show us the galaxy warp.
Show us the galaxy warp.
- Oh, come on! - Whoa! I know you've seen it.
It is in pretty rough shape.
It must finally be broken.
- What a shame.
- Doesn't seem broken to me.
Oh, well.
I guess that's the end of our school.
Whoa.
Wha So you could say - school's out for summer? - Yes.
Good, Steven.
There are many ways to say the same thing.
School's out! Hmm.
The asymmetry of this pile is really starting to bother me.
School's out! Happy summer vacation, Steven.
Happy summer vacation, Beach City! Yeah! - Hey! - Hey! - Er, watch where you're
going you little Steven! Sorry! I'm just so excited for summer.
Are you excited for summer? I'm so excited for summer! Uh, I think I'm as
excited as I can get about setting up extra seating for the summer rush.
- But lars has big plans.
- You bet I do all those out-of-town summer babes traveling away from home
without their boyfriends if you know what I mean.
- Nope.
- Maybe I'll get a few numbers.
- Maybe I'll even call one.
- Ha! Well, yeah, maybe I'll meet a new friend.
That's a great idea a special new friend to have fun on the beach with in the
summer.
Maybe if I keep using the mirror to guide me, I'll walk backwards Into my own
beach-summer-fun buddy! Next time you see me, I'll be on the arm of a hot
woman's.
You can stop talking about it now.
Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo hee-hee - Mayor Dewey.
- Er, watch where you're going, - you little - Huh? - Mayor Dewey.
- Nooooo! - Car wash kid, what are you doing?! - I don't know.
Why were you driving down the boardwalk? I'm the mayor I'm not gonna walk
anywhere.
Now, go get run over somewhere else.
I'm late for a speech.
Mayor Dewey.
Mayor Dewey.
What just happened? You work! This is so cool! What's it like being a mirror?
You work! - So you can repeat stuff? - Yeah! Hello, Beach City, my friends!
It's great to be here to celebrate the coming season.
A warm summer breeze wafts through the air.
We all look forward to the sounds of the summer season the smells of the busy
boardwalk the hot, wet ocean wind the time to take that pressure that's built
up all year and just let it out.
Wow, you picked that up fast.
You got a lot of mileage out of that joke.
You're pretty funny for a mirror.
You're pretty funny for a mirror.
- I'm not a mirror.
- You're pretty funny for a Steven! You made something new! Say something else!
- Steven - Is - a new friend.
- Really? - Yeah! - You're my friend, too.
I got to go tell the gems.
Nooooo! Don't be shy.
They'll love you.
- Nooooo! - Don't worry.
They're a good audience.
Guys! Wait till you see - Yo! Stee-man! - Hello, Steven.
- Howdy.
Bang.
- Want to see something hilarious? You don't understand.
Symmetrical means both sides have to be the same! Oh, god.
M.
C.
Bear bear! Okay, that's great.
- Anyway, I fixed the mirror! - Excellent work, Steven! - You didn't tell me
It's like a person.
- Wait.
What? Say hey.
Little buddy Uh excuse us.
Come on.
You want to come out, don't you? You have so much to say and funny noises to
share from across the ages.
Are we not beach-summer-fun buddies? Just couldn't help yourself, huh? - Just
for you - Steven! It's talking to him? It shouldn't be able to do that.
I-It should only be following orders.
- Garnet, do something.
- Steven.
Nooooo! You should just give us back the mirror.
- It will be safer where we can watch it.
- Yeah, let's bubble it.
Nooooo! Nooooo! - Wha - Steven.
Don't make me have to take it from you.
It doesn't want to go with you.
- Don't you hear it screaming? - Steven, it's just a mirror, a tool.
It can't want anything.
Nooooo! Nooooo! Nooooo! Nooooo! It wants to be with me! I'm sorry! That little
boy is in big trouble.
Garnet, wait! I'm sure he didn't understand - what he was doing! - Fan out.
What am I gonna do? What's their problem with you? Are you trying to say
something? - Away from home.
- Let - Me - Out! - I don't understand.
- Steven! Come on! I want to help you! What can I do? Ah! Wha Thank you.
You didn't ohh.
You actually talked to me.
You helped me! It's Steven, right? - Mm.
- I'm Lapis Lapis Lazuli.
- Are you really a crystal gem? - Yeah.
- But you set me free.
- But Wha - Steven! - Wha - Wait! - You You three knew I was in there, and you
didn't do anything.
Did you even wonder who I used to be?! Steven, run! - What are you doing? - I'm
Lapis Lazuli, and you can't keep me trapped here anymore! - Huh? - They're not
gonna let us leave.
- Leave? - Steven, come with me.
- Where? - Home.
- B-B-But B-But I, uh - Fine.
Don't trust them, Steven.
Goodbye.
- Steven! Are you okay?! - Yeah.
I'm fine.
- So, that was another gem? - Yes.
Steven, you're grounded.
1x26 - "Ocean Gem" - I'm grounded? - Yes, you're grounded.
- You disobeyed an order.
- Now we're gonna bury you till you've learned Your lesson.
That's not how grounding works! Dad? Uh, you guys better come check this out.
W-W-Wha? - Wait.
- What the - Where did it go? - Whoa! - The ocean! - Huh? Hey, it's those
magical ladies! - What's going on here? - The ocean is gone, obviously.
That's right.
Now it's just a desert.
No one wants to take a vacation to Desert City! Aw, we're gonna lose all our
summer business! - And all the beach babes.
Aw! - Who's gonna buy my fries? - And my pizza! - Who's gonna have fun at
funland? As mayor, I demand you explain this immediately ! It was Lapis Lazuli.
- Lapis Lazuli? - She's the gem you released from the mirror.
- That's incredible.
- How did you do that? But she's a gem, just like us.
There's a lot you don't know about gems, Steven.
How could I have known the gem contained in that mirror - would Be so powerful?
- Where are you going, Steven? I'm leaving to fix what I did to our home.
I was the one who set Lapis free from the mirror.
Now it's my fault the ocean's gone.
I'm gonna bring the ocean back or get really thirsty trying.
Wait up, kiddo.
I'm coming with you.
I want to help, too.
Also, I feel weird being in your house if you're not here.
Clearly, we're coming, too.
You're ungrounded, by the way.
Whoo-hoo! Road trip! How about some tunes? This was one of Rose's favorites.
What do you think, Garnet? I can't believe Lapis would do this.
- Gems shouldn't fight each other.
- We're always fighting gems, actually.
- What?! - Oh, how do I put this? All gems aren't necessarily good.
All those monsters we fight used to be just like us! - Right, Pearl? - Yes.
But they've become corrupted and broken.
We have to take care of them, subdue them, contain them.
It's the best we can do for them for now.
If we don't, then That's some magical destiny stuff, right there.
Guys, I just had the best idea for an album cover.
This is it.
Lapis Lazuli is here.
I don't understand.
What does she want - with the ocean? - Whoa.
Look at all this.
It's it's just like a giant aquarium.
You shouldn't be here! - She sensed us.
- Lapis Lazuli, it's me, Steven! - Go away before I make you.
- But we're - beach-summer-fun buddies! - N-o-o-o-o-o! You're one of them one
of the crystal gems.
- Easy.
- What do you mean? We're all gems, right? Just let us help you.
You don't understand.
Just leave me alone.
We're not leaving, Lapis not until you give us back our ocean! I said, "leave
me alone!" Greg, kids, you stay behind us.
- We'll handle this.
- Sounds good to me.
- Ruh-oh.
- Stand together.
Don't let them separate us.
Garnet! Aw, come on! Well, as long as we're playing fair I hate fighting me.
- Come on, lion! - You can take me! - Oh, no, not the van! - Revenge! Revenge!
Kids! - Connie? - Is this a normal magical mission for you? 'Cause I'm not so
sure how comfortable I am with you going on these anymo-o-o-re! Dad! Dad! Dad!
Are you okay? Oh, I think my leg's broken.
See? This is why we wear seatbelts, kids.
Lapis, I don't want to fight anymore.
I said, "I don't want to fight"! Hmm? Mm.
- Steven? - Lapis, I'm coming up to see you.
So please don't drown me.
Wait, Steven! - Lapis? - What are you doing here, Steven? What? I no! What are
you doing here? This thing, the ocean, this is crazy.
Can't we work this out? We gems should be friends.
- Whoa! - Don't you know anything, Steven? Your friends, they don't really care
about other gems.
All they care about is the Earth.
But I never believed in this place.
What? - I just wanna go home.
- I know how important home can be.
But that's why I'm here.
You took the ocean away, and the ocean is an important - part of my home.
- I'm only using the ocean because my gem is cracked.
If I just stretch it far enough This is never going to work.
I can fix your gem! I have healing powers! Wait, you have healing powers? - I
know, right? - Oh, what should I Oh, uh, sorry.
This might be a little weird.
What? - Thank you, Steven.
- No prob, bob.
- It's Lapis.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Oh! The whole tower's coming down.
What about Steven? - Whoa! - Grab my hand! Gotcha.
Steven! Huh? Yes! Babe city, here we come! Whoa! That's how you do it.
Well, what's that thing you always say about the - pork chops and the hot dogs?
- Look! Mm.
- So, Lapis made it off planet.
- What does this mean for us? We wait and see.
See you, Lapis.
Wherever you are.

I said, "I don't want to fight"! Hmm? Mm.
- Steven? - Lapis, I'm coming up to see you.
So please don't drown me.
Wait, Steven! - Lapis? - What are you doing here, Steven? What? I no! What are
you doing here? This thing, the ocean, this is crazy.
Can't we work this out? We gems should be friends.
- Whoa! - Don't you know anything, Steven? Your friends, they don't really care
about other gems.
All they care about is the Earth.
But I never believed in this place.
What? - I just wanna go home.
- I know how important home can be.
But that's why I'm here.
You took the ocean away, and the ocean is an important - part of my home.
- I'm only using the ocean because my gem is cracked.
If I just stretch it far enough This is never going to work.
I can fix your gem! I have healing powers! Wait, you have healing powers? - I
know, right? - Oh, what should I Oh, uh, sorry.
This might be a little weird.
What? - Thank you, Steven.
- No prob, bob.
- It's Lapis.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Oh! The whole tower's coming down.
What about Steven? - Whoa! - Grab my hand! Gotcha.
Steven! Huh? Yes! Babe city, here we come! Whoa! That's how you do it.
Well, what's that thing you always say about the - pork chops and the hot dogs?
- Look! Mm.
- So, Lapis made it off planet.
- What does this mean for us? We wait and see.
See you, Lapis.
Wherever you are.

**** House Guest ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x27 -
"House Guest" Wow.
Those water constructs really did a number on Greg's van.
Hmm.
Eh, give it a rest, Pearl.
That thing will be busted forever.
I completely disagree.
It's just a simple human machine.
I'm sure I can figure this whole - thing out before you know it.
- Hey, guys! Zoop! I've got something that'll patch this van up real good.
Is it some kind of complex human tool? Yep high-quality duct tape.
Some well-placed duct tape can patch anything up in a pinch.
- See? - I'm sure I can fix - this without your tape.
- Well, gee.
Let me at least give you a hand.
- Uh, dad, be careful! - Whew! I'm sorry you hurt your leg and your van got all
- smashed up because of me.
- You apologizetoo much.
Maybe I shouldn't have tagged along on that crazy adventure, but at least I got
to spend some - time with my fave guy.
- What if you stayed - with us until you got better? - Hey, that's a great
idea! But won't I get in the way of your training? - Yes.
- Wait.
Steven, don't you have healing powers now? Oh, right! Yes! You fix Greg.
I'll fix the van.
Nobody has to live with us.
Yeah! Hmm-hmm! Here goes something new and exciting.
Hmm! Mm! And go! Okay.
You should be better now.
Okay.
If you say so.
- Ugh-ahh! - Dad! - Why didn't it work? - Hey, sorry, buddy.
Maybe you just need a little more practice.
But I was doing so well before.
Steven, don't worry about it.
Your powers are a bit fickle, after all.
Just give it a bit more time.
Cheer up, Steven.
At least now we get to spend - more time together, right? - Y-yeah.
Right.
- Hmm.
- Garnet, can you give me a hand? Dear old dad, remember when you'd sing to me?
will you do it again? dear old dad, remember how I would sit on your shoulders?
well, how 'bout it now? dear old dad, I was wondering why as I get older now,
the days Keep going on by dear old dad, remember this, too in this whole wide
world, There's no one like yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-u there's no one like yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-
o-u My darling son, I remember when I would sing to you, and I would do it
again beloved child, remember this, too in this world of gems, there's no one
like yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-u Yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-u yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-u yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-
u Bombs away! Ahh.
Ohh.
Ahh.
You're back.
The geode is cracked.
- We must leave immediately.
- What?! - Oh, no.
- You, too, Steven.
- Yeah! - Oh, really? - Oh! Oh, yeah.
- It's okay, Steven.
I'll be fine.
You go on your mission.
- A-are you sure? - Of course.
Thanks, dad! - We'll be back before you know it! - Okay.
Don't worry about your old man.
My leg's not getting any more broken.
If I need something, I'll just crawl.
My arms are still not broken.
- Amethyst: Oh, brother.
- Now, Greg, there's no need to be so pathetic.
If anything happens to you, you can call us with this.
- What is it? - It's a warp whistle.
- Warp whistle.
- If you blow in it, the warp pad will activate and alert us that we need to
return.
See, dad? You'll be fine! Right.
I'll be fine.
Good luck on your mission, son.
- Man.
This place is janked up.
- Wow! Was there an explosion or something? - Almost.
- What you're looking at is a synthetic storm that was contained in Is that the
warp whistle? Dad needs me! I'll be right back! - Dad, I'm here! Is everything
- Hey, Steven! Just making sure this thing actually works.
Whew! Okay.
We'll be back later.
- Sorry for the holdup! - Is everything okay? Hey, did Greg fall down and break
his butt? - Ha ha ha! - That's not funny.
- I know.
- Like I was saying, this is a synthetic I'm sure it's very important.
- Dad?! - I'm really sorry, but Where's the remote? That's actually a very
important question.
It was very important.
Okay.
So, if the geode breaks, the storm will be unleashed and our bodies will be
vaporized.
- Then we'd be dead.
- That's where you come in.
- Say what?! - You should try and - seal that crack with your healing powers.
- But what if - I can't do it? - It won't hurt to try.
Okay.
It's not working! Ugh! I knew this would happen just when I thought - I was
getting better.
- Don't beat yourself up, Steven.
Yeah! Don't worry about it! - We'll find another way.
- Eh.
You don't understand.
How am I supposed to call myself a Crystal Gem if I can't even Dad? Dad?! Da-a-
a-a-a-a-a-a-d! Dad, are you okay?! Answer me! Ahh! Steven! You just missed the
funniest - commercial.
- What?! It was that one for the dog treats where the dog's dressed up like a
doctor.
If I ever get heartworms, I'm - eating those dog treats.
- Dad! You're only supposed to use the warp whistle for real emergencies, like
if you fell down and broke your butt! Yeah.
Sorry about that.
It's okay.
Uh since you're here, you you mind grabbing me - a snack from the Big Donut? -
Yeah.
Sure thing.
- I'll be right back, you guys.
- We'll be in the temple.
We have to come up - with another plan quick.
- Yo, dude, no worries about earlier.
You'll get ahold of your powers - before you know it.
- Thanks, Amethyst.
- Get me a croissant.
- Aww! I forgot to ask dad what kind of donuts he wants.
Ahh.
Hey, dad, I OlÃÂ©! Steven! Ha! You had me scared there, son.
Didn't see you standing in the doorway.
Your old man's still got it! What, this? I guess I couldn't wait for those
donuts.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ouch! - Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! - Just stop, dad.
I get what's going on.
Your leg's not broken at all, is it? It was broken, but you healed - it back at
the car wash.
- You lied to me! - Now I can't do it anymore! - What?! The gems needed me to
fix the broken rock, but my powers aren't working! It it's because of you! -
You messed with my head! - No! I-I didn't mean for I just wanted to live with
my son again! I really thought I was getting better.
I finally felt like a Crystal Gem! Now what if I can't do anything? Steven,
don't beat yourself up! - This is my fault! - Yeah! Yeah, it is! Ugh! What am I
going to do?! My powers they're I'm sorry.
I - Dad! - It's time for me to fix - the trouble I've caused.
- No! Dad! Dad! Be careful! Don't worry, Steven! Your old man's gonna - Dad! -
Ooh! Ahh! Uhh! - Ohh! - Are you okay? Steven, get out of here! I'm responsible
for this! - No, you're not! - But I messed up your powers! I did everything I'm
not supposed to do, - and now you can't heal! - I healed you, right? Hey, get
in there and patch things up, just like you patched up your old man! Double
healing powers! It's still not working! Ah, forget it! I've got another idea!
There.
See? Almost as good as new.
No way - So, I've realigned the axles - I can't believe it! replaced the spark
plugs - it's never looked this good! - sealed the leaks in the intake manifold
gaskets, and recalibrated the timing belt.
As long as you ease up on second Gear, your transmission should be fine.
Pearl! I can't thank you enough! So, uh, now that I'm feeling better, it's
about time I move back home.
Can't have me messing up more magic stuff.
Just in case you have trouble again.
- Good night, dad.
- Good night, Steven!

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e28 Episode Script ******
**** Space Race ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x28 -
"Space Race" Whoa.
Inactive.
Inactive.
- Inactive.
- Do we have to check all of them? - They're all still inactive, like always.
- We need to make sure.
I've never seen so many warp pads before! I hope I have enough of these crying
breakfast friend stickers.
- Where do all these warp pads go, anyway? - Well, Steven, these warp pads were
used to travel off-planet.
They were our connection to the gem home world and to Gem-controlled planets
all over the universe.
You mean we could go anywhere we want in outer space? Yeah, we could do that if
they weren't all busted.
It's true.
The galaxy warps have all been inactive for thousands of years.
- Can't we fix them? - No.
It's fine.
I'll always have my memories of other worlds.
But now I'm here on Earth forever.
- With me! - Right.
With you.
It really is incredible out there, though.
I wish you could see it, Steven.
tay tuned for another episode of "Crying breakfast friends.
" Yeesh.
I must be getting old.
- I used to like cartoons.
- Hey, dad, did you know the gems used to travel all over outer space? Yeah.
They're pretty far out, son.
I think Pearl really misses going out there.
- Dad, can you help me build a spaceship? - You know, that might be a little
outside my skill set.
How 'bout a bunk bed with wings? - I could probably do that.
- No way! We could totally build a spaceship! People have done it before, and
we're people.
- We are people.
- And Pearl would love - it so much to see space again.
- Sure.
Why not? How hurt could we get? My aunt and uncle had a great love for aviation
and each other.
They cherished the years they spent together, and they held on to every
belonging they ever owned kind of like me and my storage shed.
I'm starting to think our family has a problem.
This is great! I hereby declare this barn to be Universe & Universe's universe
of space travel HQ! Okay.
Now.
- "UUU Space Travel"? What is this? - We built a spaceship! - A spaceship? - A
spaceship! A spaceship? Now, remember, Steven, if you run in to any trouble out
there, you can always bail.
There's never any shame in bailing.
Fatherly advice understood! Thank you, dad.
- Light the engines.
- Roger that! - Next stop outer space! - Blast-off! No shame! I think your
calculations may have been off.
Well, they can't be off if you don't do any.
Did you really think this was gonna work? Mnh-mnh-mnh.
Here.
Look.
You need smooth, curving surfaces.
Otherwise, you're never gonna get enough speed to break Earth's gravitational
pull.
Probably swept-back wings for supersonic flight, airtight cockpit with ejector
seat, and we'll need some serious engines, - or maybe rockets would be better.
- I vote rockets! Whoa, whoa.
Hold on a sec.
We're not actually talking about - building something like this, right? -
What?! This? Of course not.
That would be ridiculous.
I mean, yes, theoretically, it's not a stretch.
You've got plenty of spare parts here, albeit for incredibly primitive
propulsion-based space travel.
The idea is ludicrous.
It would never work, although several humans, a monkey, and a dog did make it
into space.
I don't know why I've never even thought of it before.
- This could actually work! - Uh I hear what you're saying, and I agree it
would be incredibly dangerous, a full of errant this chair is disgusting.
But aren't the true fools the ones who don't seize an opportunity, despite all
the inherent risks? And I'd be able to show Steven the wonders of the cosmos!
And maybe just for a second, from a distance, I could see what's been going on
without me.
All right! Let's do it! Ooh, space travel! G-o-o-o-o-o! Wah-o-o-o-o-o-o-oo!
Ground control to Mach 2.
Come in, Mach 2.
How you doing, buddy? Wow! You think we're taking this a little far? We're not
even close to being done.
- We're not? - Okay, Steven.
Go ahead and bring her down.
Ugh! Whoo! Was it supposed to fall apart like that? Don't worry.
This was just to test my engine concept.
- I'll work out the kinks in the next one.
- Hang on.
Hang on.
Next one?! Is there a shop in town that carries F-1 single-nozzle - liquid-
fueled rockets? - You really are serious! Of course! We're also going to need a
space suit for Steven so he doesn't freeze or explode.
Whoa.
You are not taking him to space.
- Yes, I am.
- No! I'm not allowing it! But why? This is why we founded Universe & Universe!
- Steven, you're grounded.
- What?! No, no.
I mean you're grounded.
- You don't get to leave Earth.
- Oh.
What?! As C.
E.
O.
and supreme space commander, I hereby ground this astronaut - and cancel this
mission.
- Aw, man! Stupid company by-laws.
- Hey! Who made you C.
E.
O.
?! - He did.
Fine.
If neither of you will help, I'll just do it by myself - not Like it'll be much
different.
- Pearl! I'm sorry, bud.
Sometimes you just got to know when to bail.
Wha? Shh! Want to see something really cool? No.
Don't give him a banana.
That's what he wants.
Presenting the brand-new ballistic-flight-capable universe Mach 3! Spaceship!
Wait, Steven.
Keep your voice down.
- Whoa! It's even got the logo from the van! - And if your dad asks, - we'll
say we borrowed it.
- Whoa.
Look at all the buttons! - I must press them all.
- If you want, Steven, we could take her out for an engine check.
It'll be quick.
Wha?! What the? Pea-a-a-a-rl! Steven, what are you doing?! Wow! Look! You can
see the temple! - Mm-hmm.
- Hey, can you hear me?! Where do you two think you're going?! Hey, dad, guess
where I am.
I know where you are! It's where you're going that concerns me! Don't worry,
dad.
This is just a quick test flight.
This will be perfectly fine just a pop over to the nearest star system.
- I'll give him back in 50 years.
- 50 years? What?! I'll be dead in 50 years! Pearl, you bring him back right
now, or I'll Hello? Hello?! - Pearl, I'm not supposed to go.
Pearl! - Oh, this is so exciting! Steven, you're gonna love it.
Hang on tight! Mm! What was that? Pearl! We can make it.
We're almost there.
- Pearl! - I'm gonna show it to you.
Uh Uh Steven! What are you doing?! We need to go, Pearl! We're not gonna make
it! - But we're almost there! - Pearl! I know you miss space, and I know you
worked hard, but sometimes you just got to know when to bail.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Please, please, please, please, please.
Ohh, this kid's killing me.
- I'm so sorry.
I almost got us killed.
- I'm used to it.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you go to space.
We'll get there someday I promise.
- You know, I think I'd rather be here on Earth.
- With me! Yeah.
With you.

**** Secret Team ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x29 -
"Secret team" I bait my hook with self-pity someone tell me that I'm pretty
fishing for compliments Cannonball! Amethyst, did you see? I think that was my
best one! Eh.
You need to put more "ball" in your cannon.
Is that gonna hurt? Not if you do it like this! That was awesome! I want to
jump in some more puddles.
Okay.
You can try this one or that one.
- What about this one? - Whoa, Steven! Wait! Only Garnet is allowed in there.
Let's do something less dangerous.
Why don't you jump off that? Whoa.
How do you even stack your stuff that high? It's a talent.
Do it! Amethyst, I hope you're ready, 'cause here I g-o-o-o Huh? Am I in
Pearl's room? Ha! That was crazy! Huh? - What is she doing with a Rose Quartz
bubble? - My mom bubbled that? Garnet's gonna be so ma Ah.
Hmm.
Hmm? Mm - Busted! - What are you doing in here?! What are you doing in here?! I
just wanted to see how the shards are reacting to Rose's bubble.
- And it's none of your business.
- I think it's Garnet's business.
- Ohhhh! - Don't tell her.
- How are you gonna stop me? - Amethyst! - Guys, stop fighting! - Heathen! -
Here.
Let's just put it back - Steven, be careful with that! Yeah, give it to me! -
We got to get Garnet.
- No! No way! We just freed a bunch of mindless gem chunks, okay?! They're
gonna crawl who knows where, all over the temple! - When Garnet finds out,
we're dead! - She's not going to find out.
We're going to catch them all of them.
You're right.
Every single one.
Back and bubble and back in the basement! - Like nothing ever happened.
- And then we tell Garnet? - No! - This has to stay a secret.
- Okay? - Our secret together? If we've got a secret, we have to do this right,
which means we got to come up with a name for our secret-keeping team something
cool, like the Secret team! And a Secret team needs membership cards that we
can show off to other people! - Here.
- Fish-stew pizza? Eh, what's a "V.
I.
Pizza"? Well, if you collect enough of them, you can get a free pizza.
But now they're the official card of the Secret team! Great, Steven.
Come on.
We're doing this.
- Hm! - Secret team, move out! - Okay.
- That looks like all of them.
- Yeah! Secret team! - Hmm.
Are you sure we didn't miss any? - No way! We totally nailed this.
- Yeah! If you're sure this is all of them, then we just need - to seal it in a
Rose-Quartz bubble.
- Steven, this is all you! - Think you can handle it? - Yeah.
I can do it.
Of course you can! You're part of the secret club.
- Secret "team.
" - Ah, yes.
- Secret team.
- Yeah, that thing.
- G-Garnet! - Did she see you? - I don't think so.
- Then what are you waiting for? - Mission accomplished.
Congratulations, us.
- Aww, yes.
- We're off the hook.
- All right! So, what's next? Nothing's "next.
" The mission is over.
Now everything goes back to normal, and we never - speak of this again.
- But what about Secret team? Hey, Steven! What'll it be? Give me the bits.
We were the best, Fryman.
- Who was the best? - I can't tell you! How come the best thing's in life are
things you can't tell other people because you'd get in big trouble? Steven,
are you in a gang? Not these days.
But maybe I can be again.
- That kid keeps getting weirder.
- I like your hat! I know you must be wondering why I brought you all here.
It's 'cause I'm gettin' the team back together! So, here's the gig.
- I left my special hat at the big donut.
- I've never seen you wear this.
But now it's closed for the day.
So the mission is, we break in and get it back.
And bam! The Secret team is back on top! - Steven, Secret team is over.
- Secret team? - Wh-what's that?! - Aw, come on! We had so much fun together!
Getting along, sneaking around Steven, that was not about fun.
That was about fixing - our terrible mistake.
- Uh, your terrible mistake.
You shouldn't have had that bubble in the first place.
It never would've popped - if you hadn't invaded my personal space! - Aw, come
on.
- Team, team! - Fine.
You can have all the personal space you want, 'cause I never want to be on a
team with you again! Good! I don't want to be on a team - with you, either! -
Fine! - Fine! - Guys! Come on! I'm here.
I have something I want to tell you.
- Pizza.
- No! I need to come clean.
Pearl and Amethyst popped a bubble.
We made a Secret team to cover it up - 'cause they didn't want you to know.
- And now you're trying - to do the right thing.
- Not really.
I just want Secret team again.
I see.
I know how to handle things with them.
We'll have to form our own Secret team to do it.
- You mean like a Super Secret team? - Pizza daughter.
I'll take one "pizza posse" card.
Garnet! - What's the deal? - Steven! - What's this all about, Garnet? - I know
all about the gem shot.
- Uh - It it was me! I'm the one who popped the bubble! - All by myself.
- Steven I can't believe you! If no one has anything else to say, and everyone
else is innocent, Steven, I'm going to have to punish you.
No! Not punishment! - Come with me, Steven.
- Garnet! Oh, no! We must have missed a shard! - Amethyst! - Wah! Huh? Pearl!
Amethyst, shape-shift! Get small or something! I can't! I'm freaking out! You
do it! I can't concentra This is all my fault! - I never should have had that
bubble! - It wouldn't have - popped if it wasn't for me! - We should've told
Garnet! We should've told her right away! I knew Secret team was wrong! I just
I wanted to see you guys acting like friends! Garnet? What? - Huh? - So, you
two can't get along unless you think I'm going to kill you.
Steven, I know you wanted to help them.
You wanted to protect them, even from me.
They made you feel like you had to take their side.
But there are no sides, because we're all on the same team the Crystal Gems!
You know what? Between the four of us we could've had a free pizza.

"Island Adventure" - Are you sure it's here? - It was.
- Do you think it swam away? - We'll have to look.
- Whoa.
- Come on! It's time to go.
Aww.
Already? Wait, wait.
Can I warp us back? - All right.
- Yes! Hmmmmm mmmm! I did it! I'm the warp master! - You did great.
- Good job.
St-e-e-e-even! Amethyst, that's not funny! - It was a little funny.
- Regardless, we need to warp back out.
- Can I warp us there? - We're going underwater.
- And you do need air to breathe.
- Then can I tell all my friends - I'm the warp master? - I guess, but I'm the
warp master! - That's nice, Steven.
- Steven - You want a doughnut? - Chocolate jelly, please.
Wha Huh? Sadie?! I, like, just got to sleep! Now I have to start all over! Then
don't sleep at the counter! I'm trying to work! Why don't you not work at the
counter when I'm trying to sleep?! - You're always doing this! - Nobody
Something's having a bad effect on their relationship and their customer
service.
- And you could get fired! - Who cares? I'm sick of this place! I want to go
somewhere new.
- That's it! I'm the warp master! - Yeah, Steven, I know.
I can take us on vacation somewhere warm and beautiful and magical for just -
the two of you.
And me! - It could be worth a try.
- We're here! Come on.
This way! - This is way too weird.
- I'm going home.
- No, no! Follow me! You got to see it.
- Come on, Lars.
Give it a chance.
- Ugh! Fine.
But if it blows, I'm out of here.
- Welcome to paradise! - Oh, Steven, it's beautiful here.
- It's a beach.
We live on a beach! - It's a magical beach! Is that why my phone has no
reception? Why were you even here? We came here to look for a dangerous gem
creature that we never found.
- Yep.
I'm gone.
- Huh? Lars! Wait! - Lars, this could actually be kind of fun! - If I'm going
to be bored out of my mind and possibly die, I'm gonna go to work and get paid
for it.
Okay.
Where is it? - What? - The teleporter thing! Where is it?! - Oh, it it wouldn't
disappear, would it? - No, no, no.
- Well, maybe.
- What?! It's okay! The gems'll come save us when they see I'm missing
eventually.
Steven, how could you do this?! We're stranded! Calm down! Is this the worst
place to be stuck in? Ugh! You calm down.
I'm gonna find better reception.
Well, I think it's amazing, Steven.
- Nothing! - Guys, check it out! I found these rocks that look like pillows! -
Heh.
Good job, Steven.
- My rock's too close to those other rocks.
Sadie, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
- Tell me about it.
- You were gonna love it here so much.
- You'd never want to leave.
- Don't worry.
Lars is just a tough nut.
He can't keep up this schtick forever.
I could do without the audio commentary! - Good night, Sadie.
- Night, Steven.
- Any late lunch, early dinner yet? - Uh, no luck.
What about you? Mmm No.
But I can see why.
My bait is too adorable to eat! Everything on this island has such a bright,
happy smile.
- Ugh! No signal over here, either.
- Hey! Uh, maybe you should help out if you want to eat! Grr! Sadie! We're
gonna live! - I catch, you cook! - You ain't the boss of me.
Whatever.
I don't know.
Looks done to me.
Ooh! Who's first? Me, me, me! - It keeps looking at me.
- Maybe it knows it's your - fault for getting us lost.
- Thank you.
- Mmm.
Mmm, Lars, this is really good! - Hmm? - You can really cook! - Heh! Fire
nature's microwave.
Could this night get any better?! Isn't this such a beautiful night? whoa-oh
we're underneath a thousand shining stars Isn't it nice to find yourself
somewhere different? whoa-oh Why don't you let yourself just be wherever you
are? Look at this place look at your faces I've never seen you look like this
before isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different? whoa-oh Why don't
you let yourself just be wherever you are? Look at this place look at your
faces they're shining like a thousand shining stars isn't it nice to find
yourself somewhere different? whoa-oh Why don't you let yourself just be
wherever you are? Why don't you let yourself just be somewhere different? whoa-
oh Why don't you let yourself just be whoever you are? - Did you see where Lars
went? - Mm-mnh-mnh.
Hello? Come on! Come on! Dumb piece of junk.
No bars No bars! No bars! - Did that help? - No! It's just - What if I never
get back home? - Oh! You're just really homesick.
Duh! What'd you think?! No, it's okay.
We're okay! Steven said the gems could be coming for us any day.
And, you know, until then, - I got your back.
- Sadie do you ever get lonely even when you're around people? Why don't you
let yourself just be - Steven! - How long have you been watching us?! - Don't
you know what privacy is?! - People walk in and out of my room all the time.
Ugh! I'm gonna go start on the fire.
Hey! You don't have to go! We're kind of on our own schedule here! What the
heck?! It's a gem? Whoa, whoa, whoa! - We have to get out of here! - Steven! -
What was that thing?! - It must be what the gems were looking for! It never
left the island at all! It's invisible.
A big invisible thing is after us?! I I I want to go home! I wanna go home! -
This way! - Okay! - It's the warp pad! - Lars, come on! Let's go home! - You
knew! - Uh, guys? It's her fault we've been trapped here! - Wha-a-a-a-a-at?! -
Look, I panicked! I hid the warp pad! You were just gonna leave, but I knew how
much you really needed this! Why don't you ever let me help you?! Help me? Are
you insane?! You trapped me on an island so you could come on to me! - Ow! -
You kissed me on the mouth! - No, I didn't! - Guys, I want to be mad, too, but
can we do it on the warp pad?! Lars! Oh, gosh.
Sadie! Use your fish-murdering skills! Go, Sadie! Oh.
Oh, I got this! The gems are gonna be so impressed.
We captured a gem all by ourselves! Sadie, you were amazing! Yeah, that was
really great how you, uh s-saved me.
Don't read into it.
We should do this again sometime.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e31 Episode Script ******
**** Keep Beach City Weird! ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x31 -
"Keep Beach City Weird!" Pearl! Help me! Save me! Help me! Save me! - What on
Earth? - Tag! You're it! Care to explain Ugh! What's going on here? It's Steven
tag.
Steven tagged you.
- Now you have to turn into Steven.
- It's the rules.
- Oh, please.
- Aw, no fair! So, that means we're out of players.
Get ready for Steven tag.
Advance Unh! Tag.
Garnet wins.
I guess I can win every game of Steven tag it may be my name but it's just not
my game Stop! This is a restricted zone! Only those with special clearance may
enter! - MayI have special clearance? - Hmm.
Granted.
Now that you're properly suited, let's investigate! See those holes? Their
shape and pattern is repeated over and over.
Some might say it's coincidence.
I say there's something more! - Like what? A double coincidence? - You'd
already be in the know If you followed my blog Keep Beach City weird! I
document all the weird things that happen in Beach City! You can't always trust
facts and books! I'm out here hunting the truth! Oh, there you are! Dad wants
you back at the shop! - You're missing out on valuable frying time! - It's
weird time, Peedee! - I'm doing big stuff! Cover for me! - Fine.
But this is the last time, or I'm telling dad! Big stuff - I'll give you big
stuff.
- So, you want to get your hands really dirty? - Then follow me.
- Yeah! - I can't wait to find something paranormal! - Shh! I'm picking up a
quantum flux - on the weirdometer.
There! - Whoa! Did they fall from the sky? My research suggests they grew up
from the ground.
- Ronaldo! Look at this.
- According to an online encyclopedia, which I am a user/editor of, this
species isn't indigenous to this region.
Or this dimension-sion-sion-sion! We live in a strange world, Steven stranger
than most know stranger than they care to know.
Take my brother, for instance.
He's always getting on my case, telling me to work more.
He'll never understand.
But, Steven, I can tell you're like me.
- Yeah! - I know you're someone I can trust.
You're ready for what I've found The cause of - Beach City's paranormal
activity.
- Wait.
What? Welcome to my office.
Go that way.
Welcome to the truth.
- Snake people?! - Snake people, or "sneople", control our government at the
highest level.
Look, the snake represents their hold on our country.
The diamond represents their underground mines or their sharp teeth.
The details aren't important! They pit us mammals against each other with
elections, sports, and anime message boards.
We spend so much time fighting over "dubs" or "subs" that we miss the big
picture! - What's that? - That the world is under their control.
Steven, don't slam the door! Amethyst! Pearl! We need to snake-proof the house!
- Why? - To stop the Snake people! Uh Snake people?! What's so funny about
Sneople?! Look at this! That must be from when we fought those drill parasites
on the beach.
- Wha? Well, what about this? - That looks like pieces - of that red eye that
we blew up.
- Well, what about this?! Oh, it's the flowers from Rose's moss! Is all the
weird stuff that happens at Beach City because of us? - Well, yeah, obviously.
- I need some air.
- Ronaldo? - Steven! Did you see this crater? I think the snake people might
have left it as a sign.
- Yeah Uh, Ronaldo? - Yes, Steven? Are you totally sure about this snake people
thing? - Steven, are you having doubts? - Not really just doubts.
I found out those weird holes in the cliff were 'cause of something me and the
gems did.
- Well, okay, but those red rocks - That was us.
- But the flowers.
- Us too.
- But But the truth! - Maybe the truth just isn't what you thought it was.
Sure it is! Don't get so hung up on these minor facts.
Truth is about more than that.
Truth is a feeling in your gut that you know is true.
Truth is searching for anything that proves you're right, no matter how small,
and holding on to that, no matter what.
That kind of sounds like the opposite of truth.
Look! The proof! This cast will show the true face of this conspiracy! - Oh,
huh? - That's probably from Steven tag.
- What?! - It's a game where, when I tag one - of the gems, they - I'm really
not at the center of anything.
I'm nothing.
- What's wrong, Steven? - I think I broke Ronaldo's heart.
Oh, Steven.
Humans just lead short, boring, insignificant lives, so they make up stories to
feel like they're a part of something bigger.
They want to blame all the world's problems on some single enemy they can fight
instead of a complex network of interrelated forces beyond anyone's control.
It's sad.
And funny! Don't feel bad about it, okay? It's not like he was ever going to be
right.
- Steven? Where are you going? - I'm gonna go fix Ronaldo! I'll be back in an
hour.
Yo, Ronaldo! Eh, so See anything weird lately? No.
Everything's normal.
Snakemen are real, and we're puppeting the gov'ment! Wakey wakey, mister
snakey.
Wave forms seem typical for a 12th-Dimensional being of this size.
Arms appear to be vestigial.
R-Ronaldo? Is that one of the monster people you've been hunting? No, no, not
monster, Peedee.
Snerson.
It's very scientific! Still - Better safe than sorry.
- What's this for? For me, in case the amphibinoids turn my body - into a host
vessel! - Nooo! Peedee, Peedee, Peedee! You got to look at the big picture
here! Something important is finally happening to me! - Hello.
- We know you have our Steven! Give him up, curly! You snake people hiding like
cowards in your false humanoid exteriors! Steven's got nothing to do with this!
It's me you want! Ohh! You Snonster! Steven?! Okay, okay! You've forced me to
use my ultimate weapon! Stand back! Psychic ghost powers activate! - Everybody
stop! I'm okay! - Nice pants.
Steven, your legs! When did they get to you? Ronaldo! It's not real! It was
just me again.
That makes no sense.
I just wanted to inspire Ronaldo to be weird again.
No! It It just isn't that simple! There's got to be more to it - than just you!
- Um But there is more! Steven is just uh uh a small piece of the puzzle.
Look at this! I think it's got to be um - level-8 beings pulling the strings.
- Get real, Peedee.
Level-8 beings are a worker society incapable of such organization.
Whoa.
Wait a minute! How did I never see this before?! I know what the diamond means.
Polymorphic-sentient rocks! - You sure he'll be better like that? - Yeah.
He's happy, you know? - Yeah.
- They're here to hollow out the Earth! It's part of the great diamond
authority! They'll take on any form! You can read all about it on my blog!

**** Garnet's Universe ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x32 -
"Fusion Cuisine" Doctor, it's my son.
There was an accident.
I - I know what we have to do.
Nurse! - Yes, doctor? Prep the patient for emergency surgery.
We're gonna go - under the knife.
- Ugh! This show is so good! Thank you so much for letting me watch "Under the
knife" here, Steven.
- How come you can't watch the show at home? - My mom says this doesn't
represent a real emergency room.
How did his legs get into his brain?! She just doesn't understand that it's
satire.
- Is that your phone? - It's probably my mom.
Called it.
Hi, mother.
It's Connie.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm at the home of Steven Universe.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, ma'am.
We're we're just hanging out.
Oh.
Steven's parents.
They're, uh they're in the other room.
You would like to talk to Steven's mom? Oh, okay.
Hold on a moment.
That's gonna be pretty hard since my mom gave up her physical form to make me.
I can't tell her that.
Garnet, quick you have to pretend - to be my mom to Connie's mom.
- Hello.
This is mom Universe.
Yes.
The children are playing swords.
Sorry playing with swords.
They're bleeding.
Oh, no.
They are dead.
Don't call again.
Sorry.
I panicked.
What do you mean, your mom won't let you come over? It's the midseason pre-
finale of "Under the knife"! Steven, my parents are really upset.
They say the will not let me see you again until they meet - both of your
parents in person.
- But that's impossible! I know, but they want both of our families to go out -
together for dinner.
- It sounds so adult.
I wonder if Fish Stew pizza will take reservations for - Pearl, Garnet, dad,
Amethyst all eight of us.
- You can't bring everybody! - Why not? - Because because I told my parents -
you have a nuclear family.
- Nuclear?! Sure, they make stuff blow up sometimes, but that's because they're
magic, not radioactive! Steven, "nuclear" means two adults and their child and/
or children.
My parents think you live with - your mother and father.
- But none of that is true.
You never told your mom and dad about the Crystal Gems? No, and it has to stay
that way.
If they find out I lied to them, they'll never let me hang out with you again.
How am I supposed to choose just one of you to bring to dinner? - You're all so
cool! - Why does it have to be dinner? We get all the energy we need from our
gems, and while our human constructs are capable of eating, - I find it very
uncomfortable.
- I love eating! Feels weird.
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's focus.
Which of you would make the best and most nuclear mom? Garnet, you keep us safe
by scaring off the bad guys, just like a mom would.
But you're not the best conversationalist.
Amethyst, you would be a superfun mom! - Can moms be gross? - Why not? Pearl!
You're always worried about me, you teach me lots of stuff, you're
approachable, and you're, - like, totally not gross.
- Uh But you can't eat dinner.
Man, why did Connie have to say I have one - mother instead of zero or three? -
We'll figure this thing out.
We just have to put our heads together.
Why didn't I think of this before? It's so obvious! You can all come to dinner
- all three of you, fused into one! - What?! - Whoa! - What? Steven, you know
we only fuse in deadly situations! It'd be like like I'm actually bringing my
whole family! - That's insane.
- Fusion is serious magic, - not a trick for dinner parties.
- I know.
Then I guess this is it.
I'll never get to see Connie again.
Oh, Connie! I'll never know a star that shines as bright as you.
We have no choice.
We've been waiting for nearly - Uh oh.
- Hi, Connie! Hi, Mr.
and Mrs.
Maheswaran! - Thanks honeybuns.
- You're welcome Greg.
I'm Greg Universe.
And this massive drink of water is my wife, Alexandrite.
Hi-i-i-i-i-i.
I hope this place has unlimited breadsticks.
Don't be rude.
Bleh.
Isn't my wife a riot? So, tell me how did you two meet? - Huh? How did we meet?
Well, we, um - They met on a roller coaster! - She was too tall to ride! - Uh I
remember it like it was yesterday.
Right, honey? - Eh sorry.
- Have some more breadsticks dear.
What is it that you two do for a living, Mr.
and Mrs.
Universe? Well, you see, I own a local car wash, and my sweet, dear wife here
My mom works on an apple farm! - What did we say about heads on the table? -
She uses all her arms to pick apples out of huge trees.
Well, you know what they say an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
- Yes.
I hate doctors.
- Well, I'm a doctor.
Steven, help me find the restroom! Things are going pretty good so far, huh?
Steven, are you kidding me?! What is this thing that you brought to dinner?! It
it's my family.
It's all the gems fused together into a six-armed, giant woman.
- Why couldn't you just bring one of the gems? - 'Cause that would - be a lie.
Your glasses.
- What about them? I healed your eyes.
You don't even need to wear those anymore.
- What are you talking about? - All that stuff you told your parents - about my
family you're just ashamed of me! - Oh, whatever, Steven.
Let's just focus on getting through the evening.
So, Steven was telling me that on his mom's apple farm, they're bioengineering
a gala-fuji hybrid.
- Definitely true.
- Isn't that right, Mrs.
Universe? Ugh! What are you doing? - I'm hungry! - I don't think so.
Cut it out, you two.
Stop! You don't have to eat it! Steven! Ohh.
Thank you so much.
You don't know how horrified it was when that dreck nearly fell into our
mouths.
Eating food is so disgusting! You chew it into nasty mush, swallow that goop,
and it comes out of you? What a completely horrid experience! Uh, speak for
yourself.
Ha! I love it when mush - passes through my body.
- It doesn't matter what you two think.
We're doing this for Steven! What is going on here? - Who are they?! - I knew I
should have trusted my bad feelings about this new friend of yours, but I never
thought I wouldn't be able to trust my own daughter.
Connie! Connie.
Steven, I'm so sorry.
It's not that I'm ashamed of you.
I was so worried that my parents would think all this magic stuff is weird.
What if they don't let me hang out with you anymore? I-I'm sorry I messed
everything up.
I wish there was a way we could just hang out without - having to worry about
stuff.
- Steven, let's just hop on a bus - and live somewhere else without telling
anyone! - That's a great idea! - Where's this bus taking us? - Wherever we end
up.
We'll find a way to survive.
I've been reading about sustainable living.
- Maybe it'll take us to a real apple farm! - What's up with you - and apples
today? - Huh? Steve-e-e-n! You two, come out of that bus, this instant! Okay!
J-just put the bus down first.
I don't even know where to begin - with you, young la - What were you thinking,
running off with Connie like that? You could have gotten - yourselves hurt! -
Or gotten mangled in traffic.
- Or thrown in prison.
- Steven, you are in very big trouble, - and we have no choice but to punish
you.
- But - No dinner for 1,000 years.
- 1,000? We would never starve you, but you will lose your TV privileges for
1,000 years.
No! The midseason pre-finale of "Under the knife"! How can you do this to me?!
Because we love you, Steven.
Wow.
That was a masterful use of the "because we love you" shutdown.
I'm quite partial to the "it's for your own good" myself.
That "1,000 years of no dinner" bit was pretty funny.
All comedy is derived from fear.
- You are too much.
- I did not know what to make of the two of excuse me four of you, but I see
that you are responsible parents uh, caregivers? Guardians.
So, I can still hang out with Steven? - Sure.
- All right! Uh

**** Watermelon Steven ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x32 -
"Garnet's Universe" Steven? Steven.
I know you're here.
Come on out.
- You know I can sense you.
- Steven bomb! Whoa! I got you.
- You got me.
- And now you're blind.
Tiny hands my only weakness.
Whoa! What did you do today? Tell me what you think I did.
Huh! You reveal yourself! Top o' the morning to you, Garnet.
Nothing like some morning training to get the blood pumping.
Am I right? Hopper, nice to see you, too.
By the way, have you seen Hoppy? She was hoppin' excited to train with us.
Ya-a-a-a-a-h! Wa-a-a-a-a-a-h! Hyah! Garnet.
- Hoppy.
- Wow, Garnet.
I can tell you've been training.
- Your power levels are hoppin' high! - Yes, Hopper, but they could always be
higher.
We should train more.
I nearly had to jump on you that time.
- Oooooooh! - We can train some other time, Hoppy.
Right now there's a gem artifact - to recover.
- I wonder what it is this time.
Maybe a magic power amulet or a flying power carpet or maybe an enchanted power
onion! Whatever it is, we should hurry.
There's somebody at home that I need to get back to.
- Who is that? - My most favorite - person in the world.
- Have you ever told him that? - No.
- Why not? I'm not strong enough.
- Will we get to meet him soon? - Not yet.
He's not ready to learn that I have secret animal friends.
Whoa.
His power levels are hoppin' pretty low.
I can revive him.
Ringo! Thank you for saving me! Tell us your name, stranger.
My name is Ringo.
I am but a humble caretaker of the shrine atop Yonder mountain.
How did you get those wounds? Was it from some kind of training? Well, you see,
an innocent Fox man wanted to see the shrine.
Such a sweet, sweet Fox man.
Naturally, I obliged.
Inside rested the sacred magic gem of ultimate power! It was then that the Fox
man double-crossed me.
He used the power of the gem to banish me from my own shrine.
Ever since then, I've been searching for someone strong - enough to help me.
- That gem must be contained.
No one should have that much power.
Oh, you can have the gem.
I just want my shrine back.
- We'll get it back for you.
- Hop five! Don't worry, Steven.
I'll be home soon.
We're here! Holy hop! His power is off the charts! Be careful, Garnet.
Don't hop off more than - you can chew.
- Fox man, give us the gem.
What? You again? Oh, I see what this is.
If you want the gem, you'll - have to defeat me! - So be it.
See? I told you he was strong.
Ugh.
Then we'll just have to get stronger.
Training time! Ringo! Ringo! Weighted gauntlets.
Ugh! She just gained 10 power from that one punch! Come on, Garnet.
You can do this! You've just got to remember what you're fighting for.
Rah! Numbers have no meaning! - I'm ready.
- So cool! We're here! - Ugh! - Back again, huh? Looks like you're hungry for
another delicious beating.
Actually, that last one spoiled my appetite.
How dare you insult my cooking skills? What?! Impossible! Oh, that hurts.
- Now give back the gem.
- But I'm the sworn protector of the gem.
What did that liar tell you? - No! - You dummies fell for it.
Now the sacred magic gem of ultimate power is mine! Ultimate Ringo! Curse you,
Ringo! I'll make you pay for this! Too bad you didn't outfox me when you had
the chance! - An on - Ion Ring.
We will avenge you, Fox man.
- Ringo, you must be defeated! - Ahem.
The name's "ultimate Ringo.
" Wh-Wh-What is this place? Welcome to my Ringo zone! It is here where my
powers are strongest.
You want to stop me? Go on.
It'll amuse me.
And after I beat you, maybe I'll destroy the planet - just 'cause I can.
- You monster! Ready to hog, drop, and roll! - Oww! - Hoppy, no! Hoppy I mean,
Hopper, no! Now, this is bad.
W-W-Weighted hair? Without her weighted hair, Garnet's power is hoptastrophic!
- Ringo! - Ultimate! Garnet! I'm sorry, Steven.
I wasn't strong enough.
Ah, what a nice photo.
But, you know, there's something not quite right.
Oh! I know! Nom nom nom nom nom.
Huh? This is getting ridiculous! Ohh! Whoa! Chah! Hip-hop hooray! And so Garnet
used the gem to return the Fox man to his original form.
And as for Ringo he stayed trapped in the Ringo zone forever.
That day, Garnet learned a valuable lesson that being strong was about more
than just how many mountains you can punch in half.
It was about love.
And there was no greater love than Garnet's love for Steven.
And then you came back here and I got you and you were blind, and that's - what
you did today! - Yeah, that's pretty - much what happened.
- Really?! No.

we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! "Lion 3:
Straight to Video" Hmmm Hmmm hmmmm-hmmm - You can do it, Steven.
- Thanks Sadie.
It's just I could get a donut, which would be tasty.
But I always get donuts.
Shouldn't I be living life to the fullest and trying new things? So tonight,
maybe I'm thinking spicy pretzels? Why don't you ask your little friend? Ugh,
lion those are gross.
- No offense.
- You kids better hurry it up.
Lars and I are closing up I'm closing up for the day.
Hey, Sadie! There's a snack named after you? Nah, those are all lunches my mom
packed for me.
- Aww, that's so nice! - Eh actually, it's pretty embarrassing.
She's been doing it for years.
I mean, I know how to feed myself! They just make me feel like a kid, you know?
- Can I try one? - Sure.
But choose wisely.
Some of those have been in there for a few months.
Alrighty, let's see what we got here.
Look like a classic PBJ sandwich cut into triangles! Very nice! It's the only
shape a sandwich should be.
Mama Sadie, this lunch is a win! And for dessert we have Whoa! Look at this!
Lion! Lion look! It's a cookie shaped like a star! I guess you could say this
cookie is out of this world.
Eh? I wonder what kind of lunch my mom would've made me? Maybe actual space
cookies! I just wish I knew a little more about her.
Blink if this means you love me! He loves me! All done! I made sure to make it
extra skooshy, just the way you like it! Wha hey! Hey, get out of there! Lion,
this is the Steven bed not the lion bed! Come on! Whoa! Hey! That's mine too!
And Sir Bearington.
'Night lion! Love you in the morning.
Whoa What is this place? I can't breathe! Steven! Steven! Steven! Steven!
Steven! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Hang on! I got you! Ugh, lion! Let him go! -
What happened? - Steven, are you all right? Why was lion sleeping on top of
you? I don't know.
He's being a little clingy today.
But that's cause I'm his favorite! Oh! See? Wait Why are you here, Pearl? Me?
Nothing.
I was just uh well, you know how I always say um, I just uh I like to watch you
sleep sometimes.
And by sometimes I mean often.
Okeydokey, it's time for everyone to leave Steven alone.
I'm a growing boy and I needs my rest.
Lion, that means you too.
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! - Hm! - I win.
W-what?! That was a good move.
- Thanks.
- Dogcopter, how do you do it? - How do I do what? - I mean, what's your
secret? - How'd you get so talented? - Don't focus so much on talent, Steven.
Making art is all about communication.
A piece of art is a conversation.
Every choice you make is a statement.
Don't worry about labels or conforming to a standard.
Just be true to yourself and people will appreciate your honesty.
Ahh.
Whoa Thanks for the advice.
- And take a deep breath.
- What? Here again? I don't know what this place is but it feelsfamiliar.
Why can't I breathe? Wait a minute Lion! Lion, my face is not your bed! What's
going on with you? You just wanted a belly rub? You never let me touch your
belly! Oh! It's a trap! An adorable trap! Okay you got me! Will you let me go?
Come on now! That's it! Let's go lion, you're on a time out! I said, you're on
time out! You're gonna stay out here and think about what you did! He loves me!
Aww, I just can't stay mad at you! You're a wonderful pink human being.
Except you're not.
'Cause you're a lion.
I'm inside lion's mane?! Sorry, I couldn't resist.
Am I supposed to do something here? Wha ? Mm For me? Who would put this here?
And how does this huge place fit inside of lion's mane anyw Mm and he keeps
sleeping on Steven's face! But Steven doesn't want me watching him anymore.
So one of you two has to do it.
- Sadie! Sadie! - Steven, you know donuts aren't ready for another hour.
Really? Come on! What are you doing? Steven, that voice.
Greg made a friend.
What?! Ah! - Go on - Sorry, I'm getting stage - fright here.
- Tell us about yourself.
Well, let's see here My name is Greg.
No, no, no! This is all wrong! Okay, go! They call me Mr.
Universe! Get ready baby, you're gonna have the coolest dad this side of the
cosmos! Press the button, Rose! Oh, right! Was that the right one? - Uh maybe?
- Oh, what does this one do? Isn't it remarkable, Steven? This world is full of
so many possibilities.
Each living thing has an entirely unique experience.
The sights they see, the sounds they hear.
The lives they live are so complicated a-and so simple.
I can't wait for you to join them.
Steven, we can't both exist.
I'm going to become half of you.
And I need you to know that every moment you love being yourself, that's me,
loving you and loving being you.
Because you're going to be something extraordinary.
You're going to be a human being.
- Hey, Rose! - Take care of them, Steven.
Hey, Sadie, come on we got to open up! What in the world did you guys watch?
Hey, mom? You know how I said you didn't have to make me those lunches anymore?

**** Warp Tour ****
All: # We are the Crystal Gems # we'll always save the day Steven: # and if you
think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way # - # that's why the people # -
# of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and
Pearl # And Steven! 1x36 - "Warp Tour" Pearl: I can't believe that went so
well.
Amethyst: That was kind of great when you hit it with your spear and it went
like Bing boing Pkwww! Pearl: And the way you were circling around it almost
looked like strategy.
[chuckles.]
Well, you know, I can do that stuff, too.
Steven: Wait up! [breathing heavily.]
Sorry I couldn't help much.
I think the flowers are making me ah-ahh Ah-choo! [sniffles.]
- Sorry, Garnet.
- Garnet: I'll live.
Pearl: Oh, Steven, you're supposed to sneeze into - your antecubital fossa.
- Steven: My what? Pearl: Your This thing.
Steven: [gasping.]
Ah-ahh - Amethyst: Do it at Pearl! - Pearl: Steven, your fossa! - Steven: Ah-
choo! - Pearl: Oh! Steven: Waah! Wha? [breathing heavily.]
Whoa.
[electricity crackles.]
Huh? Waah! Pearl: Careful! It's dangerous to stick your - head out of the
stream! - Garnet: There's not much air, - and it's very cold.
- Steven: You guys, I saw - something out there! - Pearl: What? - Steven:
Something warping! - Pearl: Steven, that's not possible.
Is your vision blurry from the pollen? Steven: I can see Perfectly Pearl.
- I know there's something out there! - Garnet: There's nothing out there,
Steven.
There hasn't been anything else for a long, long time.
[sighs.]
Ugh! Uh [refrigerator door opens.]
Aaah! Amethyst! [munching.]
Hey, Steven! Want some macaroni cheese? [munching continues.]
[sighs.]
W-Wait! I can't sleep.
Amethyst: Why? Are you scared of that thing you saw warping right into the
house and attacking you in your sleep? - Steven: No.
- Amethyst: Oh! Good! Good.
Nighty night! Don't let the warp monster bite! [raspberries.]
[chuckles.]
[muffled laughing.]
Steven: [sighs.]
Looks like I'm not sleeping tonight.
[bird screeching.]
Pearl: Steven - we've got a surprise for you.
- Steven: Aah! Aghh! - Pearl: Gah! - Steven: Oh, Pearl.
Garnet: Now you're not getting any cookies.
Amethyst: Cookies?! I'll take 'em! [whistles.]
[munching.]
- Garnet: Slow down, Amethyst.
- Steven: I'm sorry, Pearl.
I just I guess I didn't Garnet: Didn't sleep.
[yawns.]
- Maybe.
- Pearl: Oh, Steven! This isn't about the thing you think you saw outside the
warp stream yesterday, is it? [clang!.]
[both gasp.]
Steven: But it was real! Something was warping somewhere in the warp! Pearl:
Listen.
Nothing on Earth can use the warps but us.
Do you understand? Steven, nod in agreement if you understand.
- Nod in agreement - Garnet: I'm confident Pearl is right.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can just go check.
- Nothing unusual.
- Steven: Ah-ahh - Ahh-choo! - Garnet: Bless you.
Pearl: Nothing here, either.
And the geode is holding nicely.
Amethyst: Whoa! Now that's something! Heh.
Steven Jr.
's been busy.
[laughing.]
- This makes you a grandpa! - Garnet: Congratulations.
Steven: Hey! We're getting off task here! Pearl: We've looked all over! -
There's nothing out here to find! - Steven: But you're wrong.
- Pearl: Excuse me? - Steven: I I mean Pearl: Nothing on Earth can use these
warps but us! Steven: Well, what if it came from space? Pearl: I don't
appreciate your tone.
These are the warps that once connected us to other planets.
If something tried to come from space, it would be through here.
But wait! This warp pad is broken, marked inactive by the very depressed
cartoon breakfast sticker - you placed here yourself! - Amethyst: Look, Pearl's
right, like usual.
- Ugh! You get used to it.
- Garnet: We're safe.
Steven: Well I guess so.
Amethyst: Oh, man! Finally! That took all day.
Garnet: It was important to make Steven feel secure.
Pearl: Yes, Steven feels much better now.
Steven: I'm a little tired of you guys telling me how I feel! I know I saw
something outside the stream! Pearl: And I know you didn't! You don't tell me -
what I already know! - Why is it so hard to just "listen to Steven?" Amethyst:
Uh, this is new.
I kind of like it.
Pearl: Steven, you just don't know what you're talking about.
Steven: It sounds like maybe you don't know what - I'm talking about! - Pearl:
Ugh! Garnet: Okay, Steven, that's enough.
Let it go.
Amethyst: Hey, dude.
You still on about that thing in the stream? Uh, what you eating? - Steven:
Macaroni and nothing.
- Amethyst: Ugh.
Whatever.
We can hang out again when you stop being such a sad sack.
[door closes.]
Steven: Ugh! Why am I doing this? Fine.
I give up! Steven was wrong and everyone else was right! Nothing's going to
come through that warp pad! [high-pitched whine.]
[gasps.]
[laughing.]
You were the thing in the warp stream! You did come from space.
[gasps.]
You're trying to get to the warp pad, aren't you? Amethyst, come back! Oof! I
knew it! I did see something! Guys! I was right! Waah! Guys! Come on! Check
this out! Ow! Unh! Aah! Sorry! Huh? Oh, no, you don't! Garnet! Amethyst! Pe-e-
e-arl! Where are you going?! Huh? Y-you're coming from all over? Ow! Hey! Stop
it! Whoa! Unh! Huh? [grunting.]
I won't let you Unh! [panting.]
[shuddered breathing.]
[sighs.]
I was right.
[chuckles weakly.]
And now I'm gonna die a tired, frozen little sad sack.
[warp stream activates.]
Huh? [gasps.]
Garnet: Take deep breaths.
So, this is what you saw.
- Steven: I don't care about that! - Garnet: I do.
I should've listened to you.
You're a Crystal Gem, too.
Pearl: Steven, are you okay?! Amethyst heard the warp pad activating, and
Garnet said you were floating outside the stream and Uh what is that? - Steven:
You don't know? - Amethyst: Whoa.
- That thing's far out.
- Steven: It's some kind of space robot.
There were tons of them! And it looked like they were all going to the same
place.
Amethyst: Huh? Pearl: What are they doing to the homeworld warp? Amethyst:
There's a million of them! - They fixed it? - Steven: What does that mean?
Pearl: [gasps.]
I don't know.
[warp stream activates.]
[all gasp.]
Garnet: [grunts.]
Huah! - Hmm - Pearl: Who is that? Garnet: No idea.
Log date: 312.
This is Peridot, performing - Earth hub maintenance check.
- Steven: Peridot.
Her name is Peridot.
[muffled speaking.]
Warp repair a success.
All 79 flask robonoids deployed and accounted for.
Preparing to locate and manually reactivate kinderga [gasps.]
Steven: Aww.
The little ones are like her babies.
[creaking.]
[gasps.]
Now to access the domestic warp.
Huh? Huh.
This site may have been compromised.
[beeping.]
Pearl: They're coming back.
I can't do this! - Not again! - Amethyst: We're dead! - We are so dead! -
Steven: Was that another gem? Where did she come from? What was she trying to
do? - Huh? - Garnet: It doesn't matter.
- Steven: Whoa.
- Amethyst: Oh.
Garnet: [grunting.]
She's not coming back.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e37 Episode Script ******
**** Alone Together ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - that's why the people - of this world - believe in -
Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl And Steven! 1x37 - "Alone Together" A 5, 6, 7, 8!
Be serious.
Pay attention now, Steven.
- See? - Mm.
I don't get it.
I thought I almost had it.
Nobody expects you to be able to perform - fusion right away, Steven.
- Yeah! - It's really hard, even for us.
- Not for me.
We'll keep working on the dance for now, and who knows? In a few years I
wonder, though, if Steven's body is capable of fusion.
Fusion merges the physical forms of gems.
But Steven is half human.
He's organic.
- Organic? - Aww, come on.
It's Steven! Who knows what's gonna happen? Well, I think Steven can do it.
- Can you get them to write out the steps? - No, I-I don't think it's just
about the dancing.
When they fuse, they glow and kind of phase into each other.
I don't know if I can - even do that.
- Well, I think it's amazing you were able to dance with them at all.
- I could never do that.
- Huh? - What do you mean? - I've never danced in front - of anyone before.
- Really? Yeah.
There was a dance at my school, and I was really excited about it.
But I just couldn't bring myself to go.
I just couldn't stop thinking about everyone staring at me.
Well no one's staring right now.
- Um you are.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Uh, one sec.
So, what I was trying to say was Come dance with me! Whoa! Whoa! Yeah! Whoa!
Whoa.
Why am I? Why is your sandal too small for my your feet? Steven.
Connie! I I did it! You did it? Wait.
This no.
This is Great! Ha! Oh, my gosh.
Look at you now! I'm a fusion.
I have to show everybody.
Pretty cool, right? He fused? With his friend Connie? Pearl, look at Garnet.
This is unprecedented.
A gem fusing with a human being? I-it's impossible! Or, at the very least, -
inappropriate.
- W-o-o-o-o-ow! You two look great together! How does it feel, Steven? Connie?
Stevonnie?! - It feels amazing! - Yes, well, I'm glad you're enjoying
yourselves, but you two should - unfuse this instant.
- Wait.
What?! Pearl, you were so worried Steven wouldn't be able to do this.
Aren't you proud of him? Of course I am.
I - Garnet, help me out here.
- Stevonnie Listen to me.
You are not two people, and you are not one person.
You are an experience! Make sure you're a good experience.
Now go Have Fun! Waaaaah-hoo! - No - Sure - Lars, seriously, he's really nice.
- I don't H-H-How Can I help me? Two doughnuts, please.
- What do I owe you? - Uh Oh, nothing! I-It's on the house.
- Really? - Mm-hmm! Okay! But just so you know, that isn't a very sound
business practice.
Sweet! Two doughnuts! One for me and one for Uh, me.
Are you okay? We can stop if you No! No, don't worry.
Mmm.
Oh, hey, sour faced stranger.
Wow! Cool pants.
Coo'.
Rave tonight.
- Like a dance? - Yeah, at the warehouse.
I'm deejaying, and a bunch of my friends from the internet are gonna be there.
There's gonna be free - Uh, glow sticks.
- Yes! I'll definitely be there! Yes, thanks! Coo'.
Yeesh.
I'm amazing.
I thought this wast a dance party.
Why isn't anyone else dancing? This is what being cool at a cool dance is,
right? This is how it's supposed to be.
Why isn't it like it's supposed to be? Uh - Hey, baby.
- Huh? Get ready.
It's Kevin time.
Uh I don't understand what's wrong.
You have fun dancing, but this dance isn't fun! You're supposed to like this.
Why don't we like this? I wish you were here.
If we were together, it would be okay.
But we are together, and it's not.
- I'm alone.
- Not tonight.
Hey, baby, why'd you leave me - on the dance floor? - I don't I don't want to
dance anymore.
What are you talking about? We're the best thing that's ever happened to this
place.
- Come back out with me.
- Why should I? Because we're angels walking among garbage people.
We're perfect for each other.
How can you say that? You don't even know us! Whoa, whoa.
I'm just looking for a dance.
- Don't get crazy.
- No one is crazy! I just don't like feeling alone here! If you're so lonely,
then dance with me.
Ugh! Fine.
You wanna dance? Let's go.
And it's Stevonnie.
I am not your baby.
Okay, bring it back, girl.
It's two kids! I'm out! We're back.
Ye-e-e-a-a-ah!

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e38 Episode Script ******
**** The Test ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x38 -
"The Test" Ooh-hoo! You got freezer burned, Pearl! Looks like you lose - all
your fish sticks.
- What?! I needed those for my "bachelor meal combo.
" Now I can't ring the dinner bell.
These rules make no sense.
The game of citchen calamity may be played for fun, but the hunger is real!
Tough break, Pearl.
"The sponge in your sink is covered in mold.
" But I can still eat it, right? No, no, that means you lose two turns.
- That's bologna! - Wait! - You have a bologna card? - Garnet, your move.
I'm now the owner of the golden can opener.
Yessss.
Now you can check your soups for the alphabet bonus! - Who wrote this game? -
My turn! I've got to roll the dice to escape the eggquake! Come on.
Papa needs a new skillet! Yeah! Double sunnies! I did it! I win! Yeah! This
citchen calamity has been cleaned up! Whoo-hoo! - I don't get it, but nice job.
- Yes, well done.
That was very very complicated.
Well played.
So, what do you want to play next? - There are more? - Oh, sure! I've got
polypoly, toppler, and conquerors of eldermore Not that sorry, don't wake
father figure, and noninvasive operation.
I think that one's missing a couple organs.
I also have checkers, if you want to take tur The sea spire statue.
Pfft! Oh! - So that's where you left it.
- I forgot I still had this.
I I'm really sorry I forgot it on our mission that time.
- Oh, Steven - If I'd just remembered to pack it, then maybe the sea spire
would still be around.
But now it's gone forever 'cause of me.
Well, yeah, but - Don't worry about it, guy.
- You did your best on that mission, and that's what counts.
But the sea spire! It was a special, important gem place.
Oh, Steven, no, no, no.
If the spire had been crucial, we wouldn't have used it as a test for you.
- It's fine, really.
- Test? What do you mean "test"? Eh well, it wasn't really a "test," per se,
not in the traditional sense.
We just wanted to see if you were ready to go on missions.
That's exactly what a test is! - Eh - Steven, it wasn't something we planned
behind your back.
- We just saw an opportunity, an - And I failed it.
- I failed the test.
- No way! - You got at least a 50%.
- Oh! And you had that raft, so we didn't have to swim home.
That's a solid 75! Not failing at all! Besides, that spire was in much worse
shape than we thought.
- It should've been even easier.
- I failed an easy test?! Nice one.
- That's not what I meant! I - No! I need another test a hard one! - But,
Steven, you've come so far.
- Let me prove it! - Test me! Test me! - Hmm All right, Steven.
We've adjusted the metaphysical properties of the temple to create a customized
dungeon for you.
Now just beyond here are three chambers designed by each of us to simulate the
challenges of a mission.
Should you succeed, you'll unlock the final door, where - we will be waiting
for you.
- All right! - That's more like it.
- Steven, this won't be easy.
Be careful in there.
Right.
I won't let you down this time.
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah! - Get amped, Steven! - I'm ready.
Good luck! You're gonna need it! Roomer-o uno.
I wonder if Amethyst made this one.
Definitely Amethyst.
The door! Unh! Whoa! Unh! Wha? Uh-oh.
Uh Oh.
Yeah! How do I get up there? Huh? Hmm Oh! A music puzzle.
Must be Pearl's room.
Only she would make me think.
Okay.
Let's see um Bing.
# bing # bing bing Did that do it? Easy! Not easy! Whoo-hoo! That was close.
That was really close.
All right, let's see what we got.
Looks like Garnet turned up the heat.
Nice one, Steven.
Huh? What? Oh, no.
It can't be true.
What?! It didn't even matter?! This too?! Everything's rigged! Ah! I can't
believe it.
"It won't be easy.
Good luck! You're gonna need it!" How am I supposed to prove myself if you guys
keep What's taking him so long? I didn't think mine was very difficult.
Do you think he hurt himself? There's no way.
It's impossible for him to fail.
Ugh! So what's the point? The point is that he's come so far.
He can make Rose's bubble, and he's pulled out Rose's shield twice.
But he's lost his healing powers.
We have to give him another success.
He can't lose his confidence like that again.
- We're bad at this.
- What? Yeah, you can't control him, and he shouldn't be taking advice from me,
and we don't have Rose - to tell us what to do! - But he needs us to - show him
how to be a gem! - Steven is not just a gem.
There has never been anything or anyone like Steven.
We don't know what he needs.
Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Steven! - Ye-eah! Congrats, little man! Hoo hoo hoo hoo! -
Yes.
Well done.
- Yeah, Steven! - You did it.
- Hoo! Hoo! Hoo Thank goodness you made it.
- How did it go? - I can't believe you guys.
That was so insane! Where do I even begin? Man, you should've seen me! That
boulder was comin' at me, and I just jumped for it! And then, the tiles were
going like # bing bong bing! # And I was like, "I see what's going on here!"
And I thought, "there's no way I could've been ready for all that fire and lava
and spikes," but I did it! I really did it.
I you guys are the best.
Thank you so much for doing this for me.
- This was just what I needed.
- Oh, Steven.
Aww! Shucks, guy! - Mmm.
- I'm so proud of you.
Yeah! You da man! I knew you could do It.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e39 Episode Script ******
**** Future Vision ****
All: # We are the Crystal Gems # we'll always save the day Steven: # and if you
think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way # - # that's why the people # -
# of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and
Pearl # And Steven! 1x39 - "Future Vision" Steven: Okay, everyone.
I think we all know what's going on here.
I'm sure you knew this day was coming sooner or later.
I understand your concern, but that language was inappropriate.
I'm a Crystal Gem.
I'm a big boy now.
And I got to stop saying stuff like, "I'm a big boy now.
" Look, I'm sure this is tough, but let's all be positive about this.
Man, I guess I can't be in the Ninja Squad anymore.
Get out of my life, Ninja Squad! Yeah! New Ninja Squad! Mm.
That's everything for now.
Hmm? Oh.
Master of ceremonies bear bear.
I guess I should get rid of you, too? Nah.
You never know when I'll need a cool deejay for a fun party, right? Who-o-o-o-
ah! - Uh.
Garnet! - Good morning to you, Steven.
Steven: Boy, I sure am lucky you showed up when you did.
- Luck's got nothing to do with it.
- Steven: Wait.
- What do you mean by that? - Garnet: Don't worry about it.
Steven: No, seriously.
How do you always know - where to be? - Garnet: Mmm.
I don't think you can handle that information.
Steven: Are you gonna tell me something cool about yourself? - Garnet: Nope.
- Steven: Aw, come on.
- I'm a large man now.
- Garnet: Well I guess you could say that I have a sort of future vision.
[Zing!.]
I'm able to see possible outcomes to most situations, which comes in handy
since you seem to attract a lot of danger.
- Well, danger is my middle name.
- Garnet: That's a lie.
- Your middle name is cutie pie.
- Steven: Haaa! [mid-tempo music plays.]
Oon-dohng hah jah! Cha! Hana dool, dool dool.
Seht dool, neht dool.
Duh-suht dool.
Yuh-suht dool.
Il-gohb dool, yuh-duhlp.
Geh sohk hah jah! Hana dool, dool dool.
Seht dool, neht dool.
Duh-suht dool.
Yuh-suht dool.
Il-gohb dool.
Yuh-duhlp [Zap!.]
Garnet: Okay, we're done.
Steven: But the day still has so much potential.
Garnet, what are my breakfast possibilities? Garnet: Well, you're already
outside, so you'll probably - go to the Big Donut.
- Steven: Wow.
That's amazing.
Um, do you see any possible futures where you, um, come with me and have a
great time? Garnet: Hmm.
[Musical whirring.]
[Whirring resumes.]
[Whirring resumes.]
- Yes.
- Steven: [gasps.]
Really?! Then let's go! - So, can Pearl and Amethyst see the future, too? -
Garnet: No one can see the future.
I can see options and trajectories.
Time is like a river that splits into creeks or pools into lakes or careens
down waterfalls.
I have the map, and I steer the ship.
Steven: I see.
[Doorbell rings.]
So, what would happen if I said - hi to Sadie? - Garnet: The most probable
outcome is that Sadie will say hi back.
- Steven: Hmm.
Hi, Sadie! - Oh, hi, Steven.
[laughs.]
Oh, that was an easy one.
What would happen if I said hi to my BFF, Lars? Our friendship is deep, but
complicated.
So the outcome of this - experiment is way unpredictable.
- Garnet: I see a single potential future where Lars gives you a high five.
[gasps.]
Garnet: And two more potential futures where you suffer third-degree burns -
all over your body.
- A high five from Lars! - Hi, Lars! - Ughh! - Steven: Ohh! - Criminy! Are you
okay?! - That coffee was really hot! - I drink coffee for breakfast.
Steven: [nervous chuckling.]
Funny.
You know exactly what I want.
Any possible futures here where I'm hurt by this? Garnet: Hmm.
Mm.
Tons.
Steven: Uh like what? Garnet: Well, for starters [gasps.]
Garnet: you could just be going on about your business, eating your fry bits,
and then suddenly you choke to death! [Plink!.]
[Whistle!.]
Or you get so distracted that you fall down a manhole! [Splash!.]
[Plink.]
You could get food poisoning, or be bullied by wasps.
[Wasps laughing.]
[plink!.]
And that's just a few instances off the top of my head.
Steven: W-What if I stand perfectly still? Garnet: You'll probably get a really
bad sunburn.
Yeah.
Steven: Uh, Garnet, wait up! [Breathing heavily.]
[Music.]
[Zing!.]
[Shark growls.]
[Water gurgling.]
[plink.]
[Zing!.]
[Bonk!.]
[Plink!.]
[Zing!.]
[Flying saucer whirring.]
Cookie cat! You're real?! [Zap!.]
Oh, noo! I ever considered that you would be evil! [Plink!.]
[Panting.]
- Garnet: Steven.
- Steven: Aah! Garnet: Nice helmet.
[scoffs.]
[Chuckling.]
Yeah.
[Haltingly.]
You You never know when you're gonna ride a bike.
Garnet: And you're making a sandwich.
Steven: Yeah.
Just got to pick up the knife and s-spread the mayonnaise.
[Clears throat.]
Pick up the [whimpers.]
the knife! [Whimpering.]
Pick up [heart beating.]
kni-i-fe! Aah! [Panting.]
Garnet: Steven.
Steven: Wait! Wait! I've got it.
[Plop!.]
- That will kill you faster.
- Steven: Not funny! - Garnet: Oh.
- Amethyst: Nice noggin, Steven.
[Laughs.]
[Panting.]
Huh! - Pearl: We're ready, Garnet.
- Steven: Wait.
You're going on a mission? Hold on! Don't leave me! At least tell me what's
gonna happen with my lunch! - Do I choke on a pickle? - Garnet: Mm, you don't
choke - on a pickle.
- Steven: That means something - else happens with the pickle! - Pearl: Garnet!
- Shouldn't we be going? - Steven, I can't be with you all the time.
Just trust me when I say that you are in control.
Do not go on the roof! No matter what.
[Thunder crashing.]
Steven: [whimpers.]
What could possibly happen to me on the roof? [Thunder crashes.]
Aah! [Wind whistling.]
Ugh.
[Breathing heavily.]
Okay.
Calm down.
Maybe I should just get a snack.
[Gasps.]
But what if [Zap!.]
Ooh! [Plink!.]
Ugh! How come you guys are back?! - We're made of magic.
- Yeah! Magic! [Plink!.]
[Both laughing.]
Steven: Aaaah! [Thunder crashes.]
Aah! Ugh! Master of ceremonies bear bear.
[Thinking.]
I'm a big boy now! Big boy now! Boy now! What's happening to me? I'm supposed
to be a Crystal Gem.
I'm supposed to be a Crystal Gem! [Thunder crashes.]
Aaaaaah! Ugh! [Thunder crashing.]
[Music.]
[breathing heavily.]
Okay.
I'm here.
What are you gonna do to me, future? Garnet: Steven! Get off the roof! Steven:
No! If something is going to happen - to me, just let it happen.
- Garnet: Steven! - You don't understand.
- Steven: No, you don't understand.
Everything I do shoves me violently towards the end! The more I know, the more
I know that I don't know! I can't live like this! Why did you tell me about
future vision?! What's going to happen to me on the roof?! - Garnet: This.
- Steven: W-What? Garnet: I knew you might do this if I told you about my
power.
I saw this, and I told you, anyway.
- Steven: But why? - Garnet: I took a risk at your expense.
There was a chance you'd understand this, and we'd be closer.
Steven, I see so many things that can hurt you.
I should never have let one of them be me.
There are millions of possibilities for the future, but it's up to you to
choose which becomes reality.
Please understand.
- You choose your own future.
- Steven: I do understand.
I [Thunder crashes.]
What am I doing? I guess I can't really see a future for myself up here.
[sighs.]
Mm.
[Breathing heavily.]
I'll watch out for myself from now on.
[Thunder rumbling.]
[zap!.]
- What was that? - Garnet: Oh, nothing important.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e40 Episode Script ******
**** On the Run ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x40 - "On
the Run" Whoa.
How are they gonna get out of this one? Oh, that's how.
You're back! Hey, it's those things from the galaxy warp.
- Why'd you bring them home? - We can't have them reactivating and fixing the
homeworld warp.
Hey, Steven, check this out! - Kabloosh! - Amethyst, please! This is serious!
We need to understand these things, not squash them.
If homeworld gems are trying to return to Earth they have to be stopped! Pearl,
calm down.
We're still cut off.
- The Earth is safe.
- Safe from what? What do the homeworld gems want to do? Steven, a very long
time ago, gems tried to do something very bad.
It was something that would have damaged the Earth.
Some gems, like your mother, Garnet, and myself felt that this was unfair to
the life that already existed here, and so we swore to never let the Earth be
used for their purposes, even if it meant even if it meant we could - never go
home.
- We chose Earth.
Wait a sec.
So that means We're just like the No Home Boys! - The wha? - "The No Home
Boys!" It's a book series about these boys who have no home.
So they travel around the country, living in boxcars, and riding river rafts,
solving mysteries! They had a successful run, until the disastrous graphic-
novel adaptation.
But my favorite story is this classic one where the No Home Boys are chased
across the countryside by a mysterious pursuer, which turns out to be the very
fear resting within themselves.
Steven, we are not like the No Home Boys.
We are literally standing in your home right now.
Aw, I wish I was a No Home Boy.
No past, no future, just the open road.
Yeah, sounds like fun.
- Let's do it.
- Really?! Yeah.
Let's run! It's time to get movin' time for us to have some fun there's no time
to hang around our adventure's just begun we'll be thinking 'bout our friends
as we chase the setting sun but we're leaving them behind, we're on the run
We're on the run I don't care about what all the others say - # We're on the
run # - # but I guess there are some things # that will just never go away - #
we're on the run # - # I wish that I could say that # there's no better place
than home but home's a place that I have never known that's why we're on the
run The The raccoon is back! Um, Amethyst? Can I have some of your food? - Oh,
uh, sorry, dude.
- My bindle couldn't fit enough food for me and a raccoon.
Why didn't you bring your backpack? It wouldn't fit in my bindle? Maybe I can
just sleep this hunger off.
Just like the No Home Boys.
You know, I feel like I've been misled about hay.
It always looks so soft in those illustrations, but it's actually really
scratchy.
Amethyst, I want to go home now.
Amethyst? I'm done pretending to be - a No Home Boy.
- Not me.
I'm sure Garnet and Pearl are worried sick about us, wondering when we're
coming home.
That's not my home.
But Oh, that's right.
- You're from homeworld.
- That's not my home, either! - Then where are you from? - I'll show you.
Here we are! Welcome to the Kindergarten! What do you think? - Uh it's great! -
Sure is! Come on! - What is this place? - It's kind of where I'm from.
- But I thought gems were from space? - Pearl and Garnet are, but I was made
here on Earth, like you.
Check it out! Oh, man.
I missed this guy.
- Aww! It's my climbing rock.
- Uh, hello! And over there that's the sitting rock.
And that was the one rock that I kicked into two rocks! Uh, how long did you
live here? For a while, I guess, um, at least until I met your mom and the
others.
Whoa! What is that thing? Eh, it's just some old gem junk from a long time ago.
It's probably busted by now.
Hey, Steven.
Look.
- Here's the hole I came out of! - Hang on.
What? It's my hole! Look It's me-sized.
- Still got that good hole smell.
- You came out of this hole? This is where I was made, dude.
One day, just right out of this hole.
So, what about the other holes? There you are! - Great.
Here comes the fun police.
- Garnet said you'd be here, but I didn't want to believe it.
Amethyst, what were you thinking bringing Steven - to a Kindergarten!? - I
don't know.
- We were in the neighborhood.
- Pearl? - Was Amethyst really made here? - How much did you tell him? What?
You mean about the bad thing? How this bad place is where bad gems came to grow
more bad gems? Is that what you're talking about? They grew other gems here? -
Amethyst, he's not ready! - Oh, but don't worry, Steven.
Everything's just fine now.
- Amethyst.
- It all worked out.
- We won! - Stop.
- And we shut this place down so the Earth - Stop.
- would be safe from parasites like me! - Amethyst, that's enough! - Pearl? -
Steven, I'm sorry.
I never wanted you to see this horrible place.
Then why don't you just leave! Admit it I'm just an embarrassment to you!
Amethyst! Wait! I don't want to fight you.
I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- You guys, stop it! - Stay out of it! Amethyst, stop this! You can't beat me.
I don't care! I'm not gonna let you stand there and remind me of everything I
hate about myself! I never asked for it to be this way.
I never asked to be made! - Amethyst.
- Amethyst, please, no more! I know you're upset, but I can't bear to watch you
two hurt each other.
Amethyst! Amethyst, Amethyst! Amethyst! Amethyst! Where are you?! - Amethyst.
- Go away.
I'm bad, and you shouldn't be around me.
What? That's ridiculous.
Look, I don't know what any of this really means, but I Yeah, you don't, 'cause
if you did, you wouldn't be talking to me.
Pearl, get in here.
- You got to help me.
- But You have to talk to her.
Amethyst? Amethyst, I-I had no idea you've - been upset about this.
- What?! You had no idea?! Ho! This is like my entire existence! You want to
pretend that none of this ever happened.
You think I'm just a big mistake! No, no.
Amethyst, you're not the mistake.
You're just the by-product of a big mistake.
No, that's not I I just never thought of this as you.
None of this is your fault.
You didn't build this place.
I-I'm sorry, Amethyst.
I hope you can forgive me.
You're the one good thing that came out of this mess.
I always thought you were proud of that.
Phew! Crystal Gems forever! Now let's go home so Steven can sleep in a bed.

I'm on my way over to a spooky-Movie party.
- You want to come? - Party? - Who's throwing it? - Steven: Ronaldo, the french

Ugh! That social napalm? Do what you want, man.

- Hey! Wait up! [Gasping.]
- So, where's this thing at? - Steven: It's right up there.
Steven! Welcome to my Beach City horror club.
[Laughs evilly.]
[laughter.]
More like comedy club.
[Laughs.]
Lars?! Oh! What are you doing here? Um uh, c-c-c-come in.
[Laughs.]
I'm scared already.
Ronaldo, right? Yeah.
I'm Sadie.
Nice to finally officially meet you.
- Boo! - Aah! [Laughs.]
Steven, you're friends with Lars? Steven: Yeah.
Isn't everybody? [Breathes deeply.]
- Oh, boy! - Steven: Yeah! Our first film tonight is a rare classic that hardly
needs introduction "Evil bear 2: Bearly alive.
" What? I've seen that.
It's boring.
And that stupid fake C.
G.
bear! Hardly looks like it's - really killing anybody.
- C.
G.
?! Blasphemer! You saw the remake! I have the original.
A true fan would accept nothing less.
Whoa, man.
Take it down a notch.
Whoa, wait.
How did you get a copy of that? Can I see the box? Whoa! In this cut, you
actually see evil bear eat the Hermit's leg.
Ho! Oh, is this gonna be a bit much for him? Steven: I can handle it! [Bear
growls, woman screams.]
Yo, Steven, are you sure you can see with the couch in your way? - You're
eating my leg! - Oh! [Laughs.]
Oh, did I miss the part where - you can see the sound guy? - Hey! - It was just
getting good! - What's going on? - Probably just a fuse.
- Or maybe it's a gho-o-st? - [Chuckles.]
Good one.
- No, really.
What if it's a gho-o-o-o-st? As a skeptic of mortality, I've long suspected
that this place might be haunted.
Aha! Spirit, I beseech you! Dude, cut it out.
You're being super-weird.
We wish to make contact! Please, spirit, send us a sign.
- Steven: [gasps.]
Whoa! - Whoa! - Ow! - Spirit, that was a good sign.
But could you send a couple more like that, just to be sure? [Indistinct
whispering.]
Whoa! Aah! That's that's okay, spirit.
- You can rein it in a little! - How is this happening?! Steven: This is
amazing! A real-life haunted house! [All scream.]
Look out! Let's get out of here! It won't open! [All gasping.]
I'm so sorry! I had no idea there was this violent of a presence here.
- Steven: It happens.
- No, it doesn't! - It's not a ghost! - Who cares what it is? We need to get
out of here! You know, I deal with this kind of stuff on a regular basis, but,
uh, you, uh, looked - pretty cool back there.
- Yeah? - Yeah! You really took charge.
- When stuff gets hairy, I just - keep my eyes forward, you know? - Once the
civilians are safe, I'm gonna come back to investigate.
If you wanted to help [both laugh.]
- Is something wrong, Lars? - Oh, shh! [Children laughing.]
What is that? Lars: Oh, it's nothing! We're all just hearing things and seeing
things and feeling things that aren't real! [All growling.]
[gasps, screams.]
[Both straining.]
Aah! [All screaming.]
Aah! Have you ever seen a haunting this bad?! This is no run-of-the-mill
haunting! It's a poltergeist! A "ghost" only haunts a house.
A poltergeist haunts a person! They're usually attracted to the terrifying
inner world of the emotionally disturbed! You think stuff is coming after me?!
How can you listen to this weird guy? He practically lives in a haunted house.
Don't you think maybe he had something to do with it? Steven: I think you can
stop being such a dink to Ronaldo.
[Groans.]
Sadie, you're not an idiot! - Both: Hey! - Do you believe all of this?! - I -
All this stuff they've got to be doing it somehow.
We've got to ditch these guys.
Come on.
I'm not ditching anyone.
But what about me, huh?! Sadie, come on.
You always Huh? Aaaah! - Sadie? - The spirit took her! You're gonna drag us all
down with you! Don't you even care?! [Weakly.]
Lars! The basement! - I don't see her anywhere! - Spirit, show yourself!
Steven: It's close.
I can feel it.
It's hurting and obsessed.
[Shudders.]
- It should've been you! - Wh-What? It took her, but it should have been you,
Lars! Steven: Whoa! H-Hold on, Ronaldo.
[Echoing.]
Lars.
[Creaking.]
- Hey! Let go! - Steven: Wait! Stop! What are you doing? [Screams.]
Spirit, I deliver the package of darkness! Return to us the innocent Sadie!
Lars! C-Come on, man.
We used to be friends.
And you threw me away! [Screams.]
- Steven: Lars! - No, Steven! - He's not worth it! - Why does everything bad
happen to me? [both screaming.]
[Gasps.]
[gasping.]
All: Sadie! [Coughs, gasps.]
Steven: It's a gem.
[All groan.]
This is the perfect clubhouse for the Beach City explorer club! [laughs.]
Secret clubhouse, right, Ronny? Zip! [Laughs.]
[Laughs.]
[groans.]
Lars, you're a riot! [Scraping.]
- Dude! - Just carving our names in! Pretty metal, huh? [Rumbling.]
Weird.
Holy smokes! The clubhouse is possessed! [Groans.]
Lars! Lars! When you turn on the TV tomorrow, this is what's gonna be on every
station! B-B-But but you said this was secret.
Our first paranormal discovery! We're gonna take on the world together! Um let
me just uh, I'll just, uh [Gasps.]
No! What are you doing?! - No, no, no, no, no! - I'm just tearing myself out.
Stop! [Strains.]
Let me see! [Gasps.]
What did you do? Oh! Oh, come on.
Ronny, know I can't let - people see me like that.
- What?! What's the matter with you?! Don't you know how important this was?!
Aah! Why do you care so much about - what other people think?! - You wouldn't
say that if you knew what other people say about you! Lars? Steven: Aah! Okay,
shh.
I've got you.
When you were stuck in the wall, was the house like your body? You must have
felt like you were under attack, back when carved his Lars carved - his name in
you.
- Can I see that? Steven: Uh, sorry.
We should let it rest.
So, all that lashing out was just from feeling hurt - and trapped for so long.
- I didn't mean to rip it up, okay? You can stop talking - about me now.
- Wait! - Oh, Sadie, are you okay? - Uh, yeah.
I'm fine.
Oh, yeah.
[Chuckles.]
We were both worried about I mean, I ran down here faster.
- Can we get out of here? - Steven: Sadie, you can come with me.
I think these two have - a lot to talk about.
- I bet.
I wasn't trying to make you look bad.
Ah, whatever.
It didn't matter.
- I don't care! - Hey, Lars - take it down a notch.
- Aah! ~ addic7ed.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e42 Episode Script ******
**** Winter Forecast ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x42 -
"Winter Forecast" Mmm.
You're roasting good! And Good job not setting that one on fire.
Mm-hmm.
What is it about marshmallows that make them so good? It's probably the animal
by-product.
You mean like poop? No.
Stuff like hooves, bone marrow, collagen and lots of sugar and corn syrup.
Corn sugar! Sugar syrup! Mmm! Bone marrow! Hello? Have you been watching world
weather news? Um no.
Steven's still grounded - from watching TV.
- I see.
Well, there's a snowstorm on its way to Beach City, and I don't want you
getting snowed in.
You need to get a ride home this instant.
Otherwise, your father is gonna try to pick you up.
Oh, no.
Don't send dad.
I'll be home soon.
- Looks like I got to get going.
- Oh, no! There's a snowstorm coming through, and my parents don't - want me
getting stuck here.
- Man! That stinks! Wouldn't it be fun if we got snowed in together? We could
stay up all night and watch the snow fall! - Hello, you two.
- Hi, Garnet.
- Hi, Garnet.
- You all having a nice time? Yeah, but Connie has to go soon.
There's a snowstorm a-comin'.
Maybe the storm will miss us.
Sometimes the forecast - is completely wrong.
- Nope.
- It's definitely going to snow.
- That's the 411, yo.
Trust.
- Garnet has future vision.
- You kids better get - yourselves to Greg's.
- Wait We can't go yet.
I've got to show you this - tube-tube video really quick.
- Steven.
It's only, like, one minute long.
I know you don't want to go, but you have to make the right choice.
That tickles! Wow! Gotcha, Steven! Come on, kids.
We got to get going if we're gonna beat the storm.
I'll start the van.
# Carabiner # - # Carabiner! # - Aw! Do we got to go? Yes.
The Maheswarans think I'm a responsible parent, and I've got to maintain that
image.
Guess this is it.
Well, Dad, if you want to look responsible, you should probably change out of
that sweatsuit.
But it's cherries.
Everybody likes cherries.
I'm a cherry man! Okay, I see your point.
Just give me a second to change.
- Steven, are you procrastinating? - Nah.
I'm just killing time.
Aha! You can practically smell the responsibility.
Isn't that the turtleneck you wore the first time you met them? They're gonna
think you only - have one fancy shirt.
- I do only have one fancy shirt.
Don't worry, Dad.
We'll help you find the perfect, - most responsible outfit.
- I don't know.
I haven't worn any of this stuff in years.
Ohh! - Okay, how about this one? - I can't lie.
That is the best outfit I have ever seen.
Okay, great! Let's go! Holy moly! That snow is really coming down.
- W-What are we gonna do? - Uhh - I guess we'll have to walk.
- What?! A responsible parent doesn't let two kids strand themselves in a van
in the middle of nowhere.
A responsible parent escorts those kids through wind, sleet, and snow to avoid
making the other parents angry! H-Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
H-Hello, Dr.
and Mr.
Maheswaran.
Sorry we're late.
Mom, Dad you remember - Mr.
Universe and Ste - Do you have any idea what time it is?! - Why are the
children blue?! - What are you do Ah ah choo! She's sick! You're going straight
to bed, young lady! That's the last time I let you - out during flu season.
- I think you know where the door is.
Since you're standing in it.
Uhh, I kind of crashed my ride.
- Are you serious?! - Yes.
I'll go set up the pull-out couch.
Uhh okay.
So much for being responsible.
Maybe I should have worn the floral print.
Is everyone okay? - Yeah.
- W-Wait.
- What W-What happened? - We wiped out.
No, I mean, why are we in the van? You're right.
We got to get out there and start walking if we want to get Connie home.
Dad! No! We should stay put.
- It'll be way safer this way.
- My parents are all about safety.
- Heh.
You can't argue with safety.
- It'll be like camping.
But in cozy bucket seats.
Thanks for dinner, Mr.
Universe.
Itadakimasu.
Any requests? Hmm.
Let's hear a song about a snack monster that loves animal by-products! Om-nom-
nom! Hello? Connie, are you still at Steven Universe's house? - I'm on my way.
- Dad, no! You know how bad you are at driving in the snow! - It's way too
rough out here! - I'm almost at Beach City, so start putting on your shoes.
I see some headlights.
Is that him? Don't worry.
I got it this time.
Oh, wait.
Ohh! Dad, stop the car! You're right in front of us! I-I got it.
I got it! I Ohh! I-I don't got it! I don't have anything! - Whoa.
Sorry, Steven.
Are you okay? - Connie, what's going on?! - Everything keeps repeating! - Hey,
come on, kids.
We got to get going if we're gonna beat the storm.
I'll start the van.
# Carabiner # Carabiner! Hey! What the My keys! I'm not gonna find those till
Spring! - Come on, Connie! - What? Hey! - Let's go back to my place.
- But my parents No, Connie! You have to listen to me! If we leave Beach City,
bad things are gonna happen! I've seen it! Bad things! Several bad things! Um
okay.
Let me just call my mom and tell her.
Mom, this is Connie.
I'm staying at Steven's overnight.
- Oh, no, you're not, young lady! - But Mom! - You're coming home right now! -
Dr.
Maheswaran, you can't let your husband leave the house! - He can't drive in the
snow! - What? - Yes, I can! - Please trust me! Hey! Hold it steady.
We have to send this to the galaxy warp without - warping ourselves.
- This is too risky.
No, it's not.
Get over it.
If the shooting star goes off mid-warp, it could explode forever in warp space.
And even if we do manage to destroy the entire galaxy warp, they could still
find - another way to get here.
- Uhh, whatcha doin'? - Steven?! - Pearl! No! - Mwah.
- Uhhhh What? Garnet, what happened? I passed my ability to you for just a
moment.
You mean I had future visions? - Tell me what you saw.
- I saw some good things, - but mostly bad things.
- And now you can - make the right choice.
- Hmm.
Connie, we have to go right this instant.
Would you look at this? An entire inch of snow.
Dad, there's no time! - We got to go now! - Wha-huh?! Connie! Oh, thank
goodness you're safe.
- Nice sweatshirt, Greg.
- Oh, thanks.
Well, we better get going.
Bye, Connie.
Sorry we can't stay - and watch the snow.
- Yeah.
It's starting to get pretty bad out there.
I don't know if you Universes should be - driving in this weather.
- Why don't you both stay here tonight? - Really?! - Wow, Mom.
- That's really cool.
- It's just safer that way.
We Maheswarans are all about safety.
- I'll make up the couch.
- A couch? Ooh la la! ChÃÂ£ÃÂ¢teau Maheswaran!

**** Maximum Capacity ****
All: # We are the Crystal Gems # we'll always save the day Steven: # and if you
think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way # - # that's why the people # -
# of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and

ones that shoot up - kind of spirally with the long tails.
- Steven, I'm slipping.
- Hold that end up a little more.
- Steven: Oh.
Sorry! That's okay.
I'm not sure the "Summer wax special" sign was that effective anyway, but I
can't bring myself to throw myself out.
Might as well store it for the rest of the Winter.
Steven: So, which firework is your favorite, Dad? Oh.
Uh, I don't know.
I just like watching them - together with you.
- Steven: Yeah, me, too! I can't wait for New Year's eve tomorrow.
It feels like I've waited a whole year! Well, you feel that way for a reason.
Mm.
Mm.
Hmm.
[Rumble! Rumble! Crash!.]
Whoa! I haven't really cleared this place out since your mom [coughs.]
Maybe this is good timing a new year coming up.
I should just get rid of all this stuff.
Steven: I could take these off your hands.
That's a start, but I'll need a little more help than that, and this guy's not
gonna do it.
Who would organize - a mess this big, though? - Steven: Ah! I know just the
gem! Here's Amethyst! - Amethyst: Surprise.
- Oh.
- Steven: Something wrong? - Well, no.
I just thought you meant Pearl.
[Grunts.]
Steven: What?! I'm not letting Pearl see this! Amethyst's room is full of junk.
She knows how to handle a mess.
- I don't know about this.
- Amethyst: Hey, man, it's cool.
I've seen your junk before.
What you need here is a system something to separate - the trash from the
garbage.
- Steven: Well, how 'bout this? - Both: Huh? - Steven: I made organizational
boxes.
This way we can sort everything into easy categories keep, sell, burn.
- What do you think? - I don't know if we should - burn anything.
- Amethyst: Ah, come on, Greg!? - What are you afraid of? - Fire? [laughs.]
- Keep.
Keep.
Keep.
- Whoa! Hold on.
Aren't we supposed to be throwing stuff away? Amethyst: Are you crazy?! You've
got some seriously good - junk in here, man, like - Steven: Books! - Ah.
So, books are cool again.
- Steven: Yeah, ever since you guys grounded me from TV for a thousand years.
- We did what, now? - Steven: Can I have these? Uh, hold on.
Let me see some of those first.
Yeah, I think you'll like this one and this one, and, uh maybe we'll save this
one for when you're a little older.
[Chuckles.]
[grunting.]
- Ugh! - Amethyst: Ha! You bought this?! Ha! Uh I guess I don't need these old
dumbbells.
Amethyst: Ah, come on.
Don't you want to get yoked?! [Both grunting.]
Come on, Amethyst.
Knock it off.
Oh, no.
- How did this happen? - Steven: A photo of you and Mom.
Ah, it's it's okay.
- It's just the frame.
- Amethyst: He-e-e-e-y! I found something that definitely doesn't belong with -
all this this junk.
- Is it the deed to my uncle's mansion? Amethyst: Even better.
Is that "Li'l Butler"? Oh, where have you been - all these years?! - Amethyst:
# Li'l Butler, that's you # - Steven: Amethyst, what's "Li'l Butler"? - Oh,
man.
Steven, we used to watch these all the time when you were little.
You've got to see this! Steven: Hey! I-I'm still grounded, you know! Amethyst:
Come on.
Just one, for old times' sake.
Okay, but just one.
[Mid-tempo music plays.]
An orphaned boy with sass and pep got dropped off on our mansion step Li'l
Butler Li'l Butler we washed his face of dirt and leaves, and now he works here
as our jeeves # Li'l Butler Li'l Butler oh, littlest butler oh, you're the
butler who butlers our hearts # # so mop the floor and dust the shelves and
teach us lessons 'bout ourselves # Li'l Butler Li'l Butler, that's you You
people have too much money.
[Twinkle!.]
Steven: Whoa.
Ah, no! Grounded! Sh-Sh-Shouldn't we finish cleaning the storage unit?!
Amethyst: [laughing.]
Oh, man! Is this the pilot? They didn't even have - the dog yet.
- Oh, yeah! They just had a cat named "Money"! [Both laugh.]
Hey, Steven, it's getting pretty late.
[ringing bell in TV.]
Why don't we just call it a day? We can pick this up again tomorrow.
Steven: Uh okay.
See you tomorrow, Dad! Did any of you order a baby? [laughing audience.]
Steven: Hey.
I'll take two breakfast-only - breakfast specials, please.
- Sure.
Ronaldo! Can I get a double order of hash browns? Steven: Yeah.
My Dad and I got a big day cleaning the storage unit.
Got to start the year off - right, you know.
- Wow! That's really practical of you, Steven.
My Dad and I are restocking all the condiments.
I get to clean the bottles.
We're supposed to wash them twice, but I always wash them three times.
Odd numbers just feel cleaner.
Steven: Hey, are you going to the New Year's - fireworks tonight? - Yeah! It's
supposed to be pretty darn spectacular! Mayor Dewey's been setting up all
morning.
There are gonna be blue ones! - I love the blue ones.
- Steven: It's gonna be so awesome.
[Laughter and applause.]
You guys? Dad? I'll look like a fool if I show up to school on just one pony!
Both: You people have too much money! [laughter.]
Amethyst: What a surprise.
Li'l Butler does it again.
You can always count on Li'l B.
Amethyst: [chuckles.]
Yeah.
Everything's always right with him.
One more? - Do it! - Steven: Hey! Oh, Steven! What are you doing coming - over
so late? - Steven: It's morning.
Oh, wow.
I guess we lost track of the time.
Steven: You never stopped watching "Li'l Butler"?! Ugh! Amethyst: When you get
to season 3, it really starts getting good.
That's when the uptight neighbors, the Richingtons, move next-door.
Ha! They're a riot! [Laughs.]
- Well, I never! - Well, I always! [Laughter.]
- Steven: Well, you want to get started? - Oh, yeah.
[Groans.]
Amethyst: Ooh, this part is so good.
[Horse neighs.]
[laughter.]
Steven: I guess the storage unit can wait.
Yeah, buddy.
That sounds like a good idea.
- Amethyst: All right! Snacks! - Steven: Want to just meet - at the fireworks?
- Sure.
Steven: Okay.
I'll see you there.
- Pearl: Like this? - Steven: Yeah! You guys are killin' it! And here are some
pots and pans.
We got to make lots of noise.
Dad and I do this every year.
I brought some for Amethyst, too.
- They should be here any second.
- Pearl: Why would she come with Greg? [Gasps.]
- Are they hanging out again? - Steven: What do you mean, "again"? Garnet:
They'd better not be watching - that dumb show.
- Steven: "Li'l Butler"? [scoffs.]
Pearl: Unbelievable! They really are! They used to disappear for days, watching
those obnoxious tapes over and over and over, until - Steven: Until what? -
Pearl: I don't know.
One day, they just stopped.
[Cheers and applause.]
Happy new year, Steven.
How's my volume? [Taps softly.]
Garnet: It's low.
[Clangs loudly.]
[mid-tempo music plays.]
[whirs.]
What's that? I'm missing the fireworks! It's past midnight! How did I get so
sucked into this show again? It's like everything else just disappears!
[groans.]
Amethyst: Whoa, whoa.
Don't go.
We're having a really good time! Here.
Look.
I've got the 2-part Hawaii special.
But Steven really wanted me to do New Year's.
Amethyst: He'll be fine.
He's Steven.
- He's tough.
- I wanted to be there! Amethyst: Here.
Here.
It would have been like this.
Whoa! Fireworks! [Laughs.]
Hey, Dad, come on! Now let's watch - some "Li'l Butler"! - Amethyst, you know
how I feel - about shapeshifting.
- Amethyst: Geez.
Sorry.
I was just trying to cheer you up.
Oh, that's right I forgot.
You're so sensitive.
I know you like making me uncomfortable, but it's not funny.
I can't stay here and humor you.
- I have to be there for my son.
- Well, what about me, huh? I had someone who was always there for me until she
started hanging out with you! Don't do this, Amethyst seriously.
Amethyst: I bet you'd stay for her.
- You wouldn't.
- Amethyst: What? Do this? - Where are you going after Hawaii? - Amethyst: Hey,
Greg [Chuckles.]
Turn around.
Check it out! I know you're doing it! I want to be friends again.
I really do.
But I can't let you do this - to me again! - Steven: Stop! [Laughter.]
[Static.]
What are you two doing?! I get it.
It's hard to deal with stuff from the past.
You want to put it off because there's tons of it and it's really heavy and it
means a lot to you, so it's hard to let anything go.
But you got to, because this thing is full! Seriously, when did you even have a
cat?! [Static continues.]
Okay.
We're finishing this today.
Steven: Right.
What? Pearl? Pearl: Hello, Greg.
Nice of you to join us.
- I don't believe it! - Steven: Whoa! - I'm so sorry about the mess.
- Steven: Was this your idea? - Pearl: Well - Garnet: It was Amethyst's idea.
Amethyst: I-I just thought we could take all this stuff back to the temple.
It can fit in my room.
That way, you don't have to throw anything away.
But But you can keep this.
Uh thank you, Amethyst.

It's about this girl named Lisa, and she's a witch.
I mean, she doesn't know she's a witch at first.
And she has a familiar, which is sort of like this spirit companion that
everyone in the world has, and hers is a talking falcon named Archimicarus.
Anyways, she goes on this quest to find her father after he's kidnapped by a
mysterious one-eyed man.
- Whoa! Mystery! - Here, let me get you started.
"Chapter one: The morning thief.
Lisa awoke with a start, the echoes of her dreams still dancing in her mind.
The low rumble of thunder murmured through the quiet house.
" Whoa! - This is a really good book.
- Uh okay.
"The house was deathly still.
The only sound Lisa could hear was her own heartbeat pounding in her ears.
The hairs on her neck tingled when suddenly" What the What was that? - It's one
of the marble robots! - What? Huh?! - Amethyst! Pearl! - Hyah! - You okay? - I
love hanging out at your place.
- Pearl, do you think this was - One of Peridot's machines? Yes, I think so,
only we've never seen one this big before.
- Or this gooey.
- Amethyst, we need to be careful.
We don't know what this stuff is.
Oh, no.
Don't you dare get that stuff on me! Goop hug! Come here, Pearl! I love you,
Pearl! Peridot.
Is that the gem you told me about the one that's trying to come to Earth? Yeah,
we stopped her before, but I guess she can still shoot stuff here from space.
So, what do you think it was here to do? We destroyed it.
That's all that matters.
Hmm.
Goop hug! Connie! The Steven Universe boy would like to speak with you.
I swear that's not his real name.
Hi, Steven.
What's up? Have you read more - "Unfamiliar familiar"? - Yeah, but I'm Isn't it
amazing? - How far did you get? - I'm in the middle of one of them, but I'm
really confused.
They keep talking about this plinkman guy who died.
- Am I supposed to know who he is? - Plinkman? But that's Lisa's dad.
Steven, you're reading them - in order, right? - There's an order?! Aw, man.
I just started with the one with the coolest cover.
Hello? Connie? What the Something entered the atmosphere.
Up there! It's another one of those things! It landed on mask island.
- Come on! - Connie, I'm gonna call you back! Is it looking for a warp? We have
to stop it! Yeesh.
What are these things trying to do? We're not really that sure.
- It's not trying to do anything now.
- Mm.
Okay, so, you read the first three books in order.
- Do you like them? - Of course! They're awesome! I really love Lisa's
familiar.
He's my favorite.
I'm just confused about - one thing, though.
- Mm, what's that? - What is a familiar? - Nooo.
Was that another one of those marble things? - Yeah.
- Grrr! What is with these things?! - This is like the fifth one this week.
- We'll find it in the desert.
Connie, talk later.
Wait, you guys! Wait for me! Stop coming here, you stupid balls! Yeah, let it
out! Get crazy! - Wah! - Guys, guys, guys! Stop! How many more of these things
- are you gonna have to fight? - We don't know! They just keep coming and
coming, and we don't even know what they are! We don't know anything! Th-That's
okay.
I-I don't know anything all the time.
It's like my whole life.
But I've got you guys to tell me about gem stuff, Connie can explain what
familiars are, and Dad tells me weird Dad stuff.
But nobody knows what these things are here to do.
Well it probably does.
- What? - We could follow it - and see where it goes.
- Are you nuts?! Who knows what could go wrong?! We can't fight these things
forever.
Well, we can, but I don't want to.
- Let's do it Steven's way.
- Yeah! # let's follow the funky flo-o-o-w# We're dead.
All right, big guy.
- Mush.
- Oh, oh, oh! Whoo-hoo! Kindergarten.
Oh, why here? This site has been damaged enough by the gems that were incubated
here 6,000 years ago.
That's it! It's confirmed! - This thing is up to no good.
- Wait! We don't even know what it's doing here.
Can't we just see where it wants to go? - Garnet.
- Mm - Steven's way.
- Ugh.
What does it want here? Maybe it just wants to see where Amethyst was made.
Maybe it should mind its own business.
I don't like this at all.
- But - I'm kind of with - Pearl on this one.
- Aw, come on.
Can't you feel this guy's funky flow? - He's a funk master.
- I can't believe we're doing this.
Why'd you stop, little buddy? - Something's happening.
- Whoa! Yes! See? I knew we'd find something cool! Let's go.
Hey, guys.
Goin' down? - Are you okay? - What is all this? What's that sound? Establish
gem-projection link with control room.
Plug robonoid has successfully landed on planet Earth and entered prime
kindergarten control room in Facet 5.
We'll proceed to perform status-check of kindergarten.
It's Peridot.
Is she trying to re-activate the kindergarten? Doesn't she know it'll destroy
all life on Earth? - Why don't we ask her? - Shh! Steven, we're facing an enemy
we don't know, a technology we don't understand.
This isn't the time to be - asking questions.
- Really sounds like it is.
Okay, here's the plan we can't let her see us, so we wait for an opening.
When she's distracted, we destroy the power source on the far wall.
Steven stays here.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Steven! Now accounting for all operational injectors.
Checking for aberrations in perimeter.
This gem tech is simply archaic.
Uh, I don't know.
I think it looks pretty cool.
Hi.
I'm Steven.
There appears to be an infestation of"Stevens" in the kindergarten.
Aw, I'm not so bad once you get to know me.
And how many more Stevens are present in this area? Oh.
Just me.
Ah, that's a relief.
So, tell me, have Stevens replaced humans as the dominant species on Earth? Oh,
no, there's lots of humans.
There's my Dad, Connie, Lars, and Sadie, the mailman, Onion I think.
Lots of people! - Hmm.
- Now I get to ask a question.
What are you doing? Mm.
Just picking up where we left off.
A gem?! More? But the red eye didn't report the presence of any gems on this
planet.
That's because we destroyed it.
You what? But the records say that gems were wiped out on Earth.
Wait a minute.
You're the ones that have been destroying my plug robonoids! Are you the reason
the homeworld warp is down again? Is this your bizarre icon?! Ohh! Why do you
keep destroying my things?! Because we are the Crystal Gems! We're still alive,
and we're still the guardians of this planet and all its living creatures! The
Crystal Gems? Stop! How dare you?! I'm doing this one way or another.
You're just making it really difficult! Amethyst, now! - Destroy! - I'm
reporting this! Is it over? Okay.
I-I might have gone a little - too far this time.
- Well, Steven, you weren't completely wrong.
We learned something new because - of your decisions.
- All right! But, yeah, this was a pretty bad idea.
Aw, man.

Scabbard
****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e45 Episode Script ******
**** Rose's Scabbard ****
All: # We are the Crystal Gems # we'll always save the day Steven: # and if you
think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way # - # that's why the people # -
# of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and
Pearl # And Steven! 1x45 - "Rose's Scabbard" Steven: This place is even bigger
and more weapony - than I remember.
- Pearl: This was the site of a historic battle.
Every weapon here was left by a gem over 5,000 years ago.
I don't like to disturb it, but Garnet said we can't just leave these lying
around.
- Garnet: [grunts.]
- Amethyst: [gasps.]
Garnet: Never know when you might need one of these.
Steven: I need one of those all the time! Pearl: Why don't you look for one
that's more You? Steven: Okay! Lion, come help me look! - Aww, come on! -
Pearl: You really need - to train that thing better.
- Steven: Oh, we've been making progress.
Now he looks at me when I say his name! Lion! Lion! Hey, lion! Lion! Lion!
Lion! - Uh, sometimes.
- Pearl: What's he got now? [gasps.]
That's the scabbard for Rose's sword! Grr! Gimme! Gimme! Shoo.
Shoo.
[snorts.]
Steven: Mom fought here? Pearl: That's right, and I fought alongside her.
Amethyst: Man, I wish I could have seen it.
Garnet: No, you don't.
Countless gems were broken here.
It was a maelstrom of destruction and death.
Pearl: But we won! Your mother led us to glorious victory.
The odds were against us, and our hearts were uncertain, but we chose to fight
alongside Rose, and here we made our stand against our homeworld! [warble!.]
Amethyst: This is great! My room's been needing another pile! Garnet: Amethyst,
help me with this ax.
- Pearl: Oh, it's been ages.
- Amethyst: Turn it clockwise! - No, your other clockwise! - Pearl: Wh-what is
it, Steven? Steven: What was Mom like? [grunts.]
Pearl: She was courageous and brilliant and [Amethyst groans.]
- beautiful.
Sometimes you - Yeah, let's try backwards - look so much like her.
- Steven: Really? - Garnet: You mean "pull.
" - Amethyst: Yeah, yeah, pull.
- Sure.
Yah! - Pearl: Hey, Steven Maybe you should hold on to this.
Steven: Whoa! Thanks, Pearl! If anything tries to eat me, - I'll bop 'em with
this! - That's just the scabbard, Steven.
It held your mother's sword.
Nothing else could fit so perfectly inside.
- For all this time, it's been incomplete.
- Steven: Well, let's complete it.
- Where's the sword? - Amethyst: That's it! Yeah-ah! Ha! You got it! [blam!.]
- Pearl: Can you keep a secret? - Steven: A secret?! Pearl: Shh! It's a secret,
even to Garnet and Amethyst.
Rose had a place that she kept hidden from all but me.
[gasps.]
But you have her gem.
That place is yours now, - and I can show it to you.
- Steven: Uh, okay.
Pearl: Now, it's just a 3-hour hike that way, followed by a vertical climb at
90 degrees.
Think you can handle it? [breathing heavily.]
I was your mother's sole confidant.
For the words she could share with no one else, - I was there to listen.
- Steven: Why'd she keep so - many secrets? - Pearl: She had to, Steven! It's
the mark of a great leader knowing just what to keep hidden from everyone
you're trying to protect everyone except me.
[chuckles.]
- Welcome to Rose's secret armory.
- Steven: Whoa! - I've been here before! - Pearl: What? Uh, you must be
thinking of someplace else.
I'm the only other Crystal Gem who's ever witnessed the armory's magnificence
before now.
Steven: Nuh-unh! Lion showed me.
- Pearl: The lion?! - Yeah! There's all kinds of great stuff hidden in here.
Pearl: I know! That's why I brought you here! Now let me show you how you can
access the artillery.
Steven: That's okay.
I can do it without you.
Wham! Oh, right.
Uhm! - We got some axes! - Pearl: The axes of ages? Steven: Ooh! We got spiky
chain lady - and her metal dealies.
- Pearl: The heretic's anguish! Steven: We got a ooh-ooh! - 3-pack of laser
light cannons! - Pearl: The quartizine trio! Steven: Boop! And a whole lot of
these armor guys! - The armor of the fallen! - Steven: What were we looking
for? Pearl: Her sword! Your mother's sword! It's a straight-bladed saber that's
pink with a red handle.
There are vines etched in the guard that connect to a rose-shaped pommel.
- Ohh! I know where that is! - Pearl: Huh? Steven: # Da-da da-da da-da # da-da
da-da da-da da-da da-da da - # here it is! # - Pearl: Rose's sword - How did it
get in there? - Steven: I don't know, but there's a ton of stuff in there.
I keep stuff in him, too.
Huh! Hup! [laughing.]
Ta-da! Pearl: But how? [growls.]
Pearl: [gasps.]
Does lion have something - to do with Rose? - Amethyst: Ohh! Of course! -
That's why he's pink! - Garnet: It's a little obvious.
- Pearl: But Rose didn't have a lion.
- Steven: It seems like her - stuff in there.
- Pearl: No! Rose didn't have a lion, because if Rose had a lion, I would have
- known about it! - Garnet: Rose kept many things secret, - even from us.
- Pearl: But not from me! I was the one she told everything! Amethyst: Yo,
you're not the only one who misses her! Pearl: You can't understand how I feel!
- None of you had what we had! - Steven: She probably just wanted to protect
you, like everyone else.
Pearl: What do you know?! You've never even met her! [thud.]
[gasps.]
Garnet: Hup! [breathing heavily.]
Amethyst: Fine! Go! - Go cry about it! - Steven: Where'd she go? Amethyst: Who
cares? I hate it when she gets like this! Steven: Garnet? Is she okay? Well,
I'm gonna go find her.
Do you know where she went? [growls.]
Steven: I'm going to assume that means you do.
Ugh! Let's go find Pearl! [roars.]
Garnet: Good luck.
[insects chirping.]
Steven: Pearl?! [breathing heavily.]
Leave me alone! [breathing heavily.]
Steven: Huh? Hmm! [roars.]
Steven: Pearl! Wait for me! [gasps.]
[breathing heavily.]
Ugh! Ugh! Get that thing away from me! Steven: You better sit this one out,
lion.
[roars.]
Steven: [breathing heavily.]
Huh-ugh! [grunting.]
Okay! I had a talk with lion! He's gonna ugh! chill out here! Ugh! We're alone
now nice and private! Huh-ugh! Huh-ugh! Huh-ugh! Uh, good idea! I'll meet you
at the top! Huh-ugh! Huh-ugh! Huh! Ugh! Huh-huh-ugh! Th-This is really hard to
do in sandals! [chuckles.]
Pearl: Go away! Steven: Pearl! Did I Did I do something wrong?! You got to tell
me! Huh-ugh! - Pearl: Steven! - Steven: Aaaaaaaaaah! Ugh! Ugh! [breathing
heavily.]
[grunting.]
Ugh-huh! Pearl! Pearl, you have to tell me - what's wrong.
- Pearl: Sometimes you even sound like her.
Do you remember this place? Do you have any of her memories? We were right
here, over - Pearl - Pearl: Yes? I'm going to stay and fight for this planet.
You don't have to do this with me.
- Pearl: But I want to! - I know you do.
Please, please understand if we lose, we'll be killed, and if we win, we can
never go home.
Pearl: Why would I ever want to go home if you're here? [chuckles.]
- My Pearl.
- Pearl: You're wonderful.
[ting!.]
Everything I ever did, I did for her.
Now she's gone but I'm still here.
Sometimes I wonder if she can see me through your eyes.
[sighs.]
What would she think of me now? Steven: Well, I think you're pretty great.
[mid-tempo music playing.]
[music continues.]

****** Steven Universe (2013) s01e46 Episode Script ******
**** The Message ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x46 -
"The Message" Whoo! - That sounded great! - Aw, thanks.
I'm thinking about calling it "Water witch.
" - Cool! - And check this out.
I can add some vocal distortion, too.
Steven, your dad's a robot now.
And now that I'm a robot, things will be better and colder.
Please forgive me for being an amazing machine.
I can't stay mad at my Robo Dad! Where's all this awesome energy coming from?
Actually, I was inspired to make some new songs after the ocean got sucked up
into space a while back.
I even drew up some freaky album artwork.
It looks like Lapis Lazuli.
Easy with the tender touches.
Don't want it to get all smudged.
Here, plug this up and help your old man work out this witchy jam.
Yeah! L-e-e-et's jam! - Uh where my jams at? - I don't think it's plugged in.
Aha! Boop! All right.
Here we go! L-e-e-et's jam! Uh Hmm.
Jam! - Mm.
J-a-a-a-am! - Oh! Sorry.
That's just the TV.
See? You plugged into the video jack.
We're making audio here.
Don't you know? "Video killed the audio star.
" I have no idea what you're talking about.
That's okay.
You leave the details to me.
When you're a one-man band, you got to know how to do it all lyrics, graphic
design, forum moderation.
But for me it was all about the audio! What a lovely poem.
Okay! We need a catchy hook Something like # Well, she's a riptide queen # - #
and she's super-mean # - Whoa.
Hold the phone.
Now give the phone to me.
Lapis was not mean.
She was just trying to get home.
How about this instead? She was trapped in a mirror and it couldn't be clearer
she wanted to leave this place and get herself back in space and, dad, you
might think she's a criminal but her friendship comes through subliminal Lapis
Lazuli you fled into the bottom of the sea Lapis Lazuli you were so mad, but
then you came around to me Uh, what the heck is that?! Must be some kind of
weird feedback.
Hmm It's not us.
I think it's coming from the temple.
- Let's check it out.
- Uh, you go on ahead.
If this is a gem thing, I don't want to get in the way.
Plus, I got to eat the rest of this pizza.
Good thinking! I'll be back.
- Ow! What's happening?! - It's the wailing stone! - Make it stop! - It just
activated on its own! It won't shut off! Stand back! Huh? It worked! Now we can
Bwaaaaaah! I don't understand.
That thing has lain dormant - since we found it.
- I haven't heard a wailing stone activate since we used them for the
rebellion.
And I've never heard it sound like that! Someone is trying to send us a
message.
But who? We've rounded up all the wailing stones on Earth, and we're not
sending this signal to ourselves! Unless - Amethyst, is this a prank?! - No
way! I want it to stop! I don't like it! If it's not coming from Earth, then a
gem must be - sending this message from space.
- Is that what some - gems sound like? - No, no.
We should be hearing a voice.
Maybe this signal is too advanced for the wailing stone to process.
That would explain the distorted audio.
Audio? My Daddio knows audio! - Eh, you mean Greg? - Yeah.
- I don't know.
- Don't whine.
Let's try it.
I can't believe it! You need help with sound stuff? You've come to the right
guy! Aha! The Lubitz cardioid condenser 680! It's got warm tones without too -
much top-end.
- Uh, plus it's got - a big honkin' sponge thing.
- I know! Isn't it awesome? Now I'm gonna add some reverb and some low-octave
effects.
I'm also adding some fuzz, 'cause who couldn't use more fuzz? Now, if I
directly input the wailing stone and run it through a flanger, we might get
what you're looking for.
Flangers aside, do you really think a signal like this is compatible with your
analog devices? Don't worry, Dad.
It'll work! Well, here goes nothin'.
- This is even worse! - I'm sorry! Dad, you can do it! You're the audio daddio!
Yeah! It It sounds like music.
Yeah! That's real nice.
Yes! Yes! - Whoo-hoo! - But it's not supposed to be music.
It's supposed to be a message.
Okay, hold on.
I got this.
- It's changing! - It almost sounds like a voice.
Almost got it! Ugh! Oh, great.
What's happening? Where's the signal? Uh, looks like the van battery couldn't
handle all this.
I had a feeling this wouldn't work.
There's just no way Greg's equipment can interface with our ancient gem
technology.
Aw, come on, Pearl! You can't be ready to give up yet! Look, we just got to
keep trying.
Sure, we don't have the latest and greatest "gem tech" but It's okay, Greg.
You tried.
Back to the temple.
We'll figure something else out.
- What a waste of time.
- See ya later, Gregory.
Aw, come on, y'all! Hup! Oof! - I really blew it, huh? - Aw, Dad I could have
tamed you I could have shown that I could depose you from your loud throne but
in the end, I wasn't good enough I just showed the gems that I ain't got the
stuff oh-oh, wailing stone I tried so hard to fly but I was thrown oh-oh,
wailing stone I got to tell the gems 'cause they should know have a little,
have a little have a little faith in me I just wanted to help you know, I have
a little have a little have a little expertise I know it's not much but if it
could come in handy I'd want to be there I think so highly of you it just isn't
fair that you have so little faith Eh.
That's a "B" side.
Dad, I hate seeing you like this.
There's got to be something else we can try.
Eh, I don't know, Steven.
I mean, sound and stuff like this? This stuff's my whole world.
And if I can't figure this out, then maybe it isn't even sound.
But, Dad, if it isn't sound, then what else could it be? Hmm Hmm Wait.
Wh-a-a-a-at? D-a-a-a-ad! I'm not that far away from you, buddy.
- What if it's - Uh, some other thing I'm not good at? Magic eyeballs? Oh, my
days! It's video! We have to tell the gems! - Vide-o-o-o-o! - Hey! Slow down! I
just want to help! Have some faith in - We over here.
- I know my audio equipment seems like a pile of Earth junk to y'all, but I -
Greg, it's okay.
- No, it's not! You guys don't give up on anything except for me! Come on! It's
not like I can make it any worse! Go for it, Garnet.
- Okay, Amethyst, try it now.
- Never started a car with a key before.
That's way easier! The battery's ready to go.
The wailing stone's ready! Ready with the video cord, Steven? Ready! - Is that
it? - Just a second I I hear something.
Come on - Steven! - Lapis? - I did it! - I can't believe my - flipping eyes! -
Everyone, listen up! I hope you're able to hear this.
There's a gem that's looking for you.
She even knew your name.
I don't know how I didn't tell her, I swear! She's on her way to Earth.
And she's not alone! Steven, home world it's not the way it used to be.
Everything here is so advanced! I can't even understand it! There's no way
anything on Earth can stand up to it! Please don't put up a fight! It will only
lead to devastation! It's Peridot.
She must be talking about Peridot.
- She's coming for us! - Lapis - she sounds so unhappy.
- I really cannot believe Seriously bad news! What are we gonna do? - Whew! -
Wha? - We did it.
- What?! - We got the message.
- But It's got.
Thank you, Greg.
We would not have received this - message without your help.
- You You're welcome.
My Dad is the best! Oh, my gosh! Steven's a robot! Help! I can't relate to my
robot son! My mind is the internet.
I know every continuity mistake ever made on television.

Don't worry about it.
Pearl: Amethyst! I just repaired that! Amethyst: Yeah, yeah.
It's fine.
Pearl: Ugh! Okay.
We have everything we need for the experiment.
And Steven is home, fast asle-e-e-e-ep! - Steven: Hey, guys! - Pearl: Steven!
It's way past your bedtime! You should really go - back to the house.
- Steven: What? I don't want to miss whatever this is.
- What is this? - Amethyst: Pearl got lonely, so she made herself a robot
friend.
Pearl: It's not a robot friend it's a robot disruptor! It should produce a
localized energy blast.
So when Peridot shows up to neet with us, we'll have something that can knock
out all her robonoids.
Now, stand back, everyone! [whirring.]
[pop! Boom!.]
All: Ugh! [all groan.]
Steven: We did it! - Amethyst: Ugh.
- Steven: Well, you knocked out - all the lights in town.
- Pearl: Steven, that was not the point of the [sighs.]
All right.
That was a start! Now I'm going to need to take some parts out of the washing
machine.
Steven, you might have to wear - the same shirt for a while.
- Steven: No problem.
[gulls crying.]
Hmm.
[yawns.]
Hmph.
What's wrong with the microwav Ow! [groans.]
What is the meaning of this?! [knock on door.]
Huh? - Mayor Dewey? - Hello, there, young Universe.
- Any of your sisters home? - Steven: My sisters? Your caretakers, you know the
tall one, the purple one, the hot one? Look, the power's out, and I've been
mayor long enough to know they had something to do with it.
Steven: My sisters? Is there anyone else I can talk to about this? - Steven:
Pearl! - Pearl: Coming! - Oh! Uh, can I help you? - [wistfully.]
Yes.
[normal voice.]
Oh, hi! Uh, Beach City is currently experiencing a widespread power outage.
Pearl: Oh, don't worry about that.
The power should be back on as early as tonight or - as late as never.
- Never coming back?! - Pearl: Yes? - No, no, no! It has to come back! The
people of Beach City can't handle a situation like this! They need their
electronic distractions so they won't notice that this town - is a magnet for
disaster! - Pearl: Oh, don't be dramatic.
I saw humans get on fine without power for millennia.
You used to hunt and gather.
[chuckles.]
[laughing.]
What happened to that? You don't understand.
Sure, things seem calm now, in the light of the day, but when the sun goes
down, so does - the town.
- Steven: He's right.
Mayor Dewey, this is our responsibility.
We'll help you clean up this mess! Garnet: No, we won't! - I'll help you clean
up this mess! - Okay.
But you're not getting paid.
Mayor Dewey - # Mayor # - All right.
We got to go do damage control now, or the boardies - are gonna get restless.
- Steven: Boardies? Hello, youth resident of Beach City.
- Is everything all right? - You mean besides the power knocking out the
freezers [grunts.]
and melting - all this ice cream! - Steven: What?! Ice cream?! It's a real pain
in the Yah! Ugh! I'd offer you some, but it's pretty soupy.
Steven: Is this happening to ice cream all over town?! - This really is a
crisis! - Now let's all calm down here.
- I have everything under control.
- Steven: You do? Of course! The power will be back, and the freezers will be
working by sundown.
No need to cry over, uh, frozen milk.
[chuckles.]
Here.
I'll catch you kids on the side that flips! You take care now.
- Steven: See you later! - Thanks for the glowstick! Steven: So, everything is
going to be okay?! - What? No! - Steven: Y-You lied to them? Look, Steven, it's
not lying when you're the mayor.
- It's politics.
- Steven: It is? Of course it is.
Let me tell you something.
When you work for the government, you can't control what happens in the world,
but you can control how people feel about it.
That's the real weight I carry making the good people of Beach City feel
better, - safer, more secure.
- Steven: But What's my other option let the people panic and riot? That didn't
work out so well for Ocean Town! Steven: I've never heard of Ocean Town.
Exactly! That's why you've got to give the people something to believe in.
When they see my giant head on this car, rolling down the boardwalk, they
think, "here comes help.
" Well, some people think, "here comes that exterminator guy," but then they
realize it's me, their mayor! Have you seen that exterminator truck with the
head on it? - He's totally copying me.
- Steven: Uh - Here.
Take these.
- # Mayor Dewey # What's going on? [all talking at once.]
[clears throat.]
[feedback squeals.]
Attention, my good citizens! As you may or may not be aware of, there is a
power outage affecting all of Beach City - area proper.
- Oh.
Really? This problem is just a temporary one, not a big worry at all! Things
could be worse! We could be in Ocean Town! [light laughter.]
- Too soon! - Anyway, the power will be back on by sundown, so, in the
meantime, just enjoy this beautiful, peaceful day outside.
The power will be back on before you know it.
I promise! - All: Ohh! - I trust this man! Okay.
Make sure everyone gets a button and a glowstick.
[laughs.]
Steven: Have a glowstick.
Here you go.
- Uh, here.
- Hey, Schtu-ball.
You get some sort of secret government internship - I need to know about? -
[chuckles nervously.]
Here.
Apparently, you can never have too many Mayor Dewey buttons.
Sounds like I'm not gonna be needing this glowstick, though.
See you later, buddy! Steven: But, Dad! Nooooo.
Amethyst: So what if she shows up with more? - I say we just mash 'em all! -
Garnet: It's not just the robonoids.
According to Lapis, she's going - to have backup.
- Pearl: Who knows what she's going to have? We won't stand a chance against
their weapons, but if we can just knock them out Garnet: It's not about the
robonoids, Pearl.
- She's coming with other gems! - Amethyst: Says who?! Who cares?! What does
Lapis even know?! - Garnet: Calm down, Amethyst.
- You calm down-uh Hey! Look who it is! It's Steven! [chuckles.]
Our Our best friend Steven! What are you doing here, buddy? Steven: I live
here.
Is everything okay? - Pearl: Of course! - Garnet: In fact, we were just - about
to play cards.
- Pearl: Yes, cards! Amethyst: Want to play war? [growls.]
- Amethyst: I mean peace? - Yeah, but how are we - gonna play cards in the
dark? - Garnet: We can light a fire - in the fireplace.
- Pearl: Yes! Like early man! Amethyst: Come on, early man! [door opens,
closes.]
Dewey's voice: When the sun goes down, so does Steven: The town.
[all shouting angrily.]
[breathing heavily.]
- Oh, my gosh! - How come there's still no power?! You said it would be on by
sundown! [chuckles nervously.]
Everyone just calm down.
I'm sure if we just talk rationally, we can come to an agreement.
No agreement! You promised us! Without power, I can't take care of my family!
Well, this one's fine.
But he can't take care of himself! I'm sure the power will be on - tomorrow, I
think maybe.
- Stop pulling our legs! You lied to us, and you're lying again! [all shouting
angrily.]
Please! Good citizens of Beach City Ow! - Liar! - You're a liar! [shouting
continues.]
- If you'd all just calm down - Tip the truck! Whoo-hoo! [all grunting.]
[shouting continues.]
Steven: Aah! [breathing heavily.]
Everyone, please! [all gasp.]
The power might not be back on tonight.
It might not be back on - for even a year! - A year? - What? - Steven: But I
know that wou're all going to be okay because I know each and every one of you.
You're smart and you're tough and you're resourceful, and you all care about
each other more than you care about microwave dinners or video games or being
able to see in the dark.
I know it'll hurt your businesses.
I know it'll hurt your lives.
But are we really going to hurt each other? [all murmuring.]
Of course not! We'll face the night together, and we'll survive, because we -
are the light of Beach City! - All: Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! - Uh, yes.
Thank you, Steven! I couldn't have said it better! Don't try to worm your way
out of this! - Oh, no, no! - Steven: It's okay! It's okay! Mayor Dewey was
hiding things from you, but he did it because he didn't want you to worry.
He was just sheltering you from the truth because he he loves you.
[all murmuring.]
[scattered cheers.]
[chanting.]
Mayor Dewey! Pearl: Oh, hey, Steven.
If I can just concentrate - the wave a little more - Steven: Um do you guys
want to talk? Pearl: And why would we need - to do that? - Amethyst: Hey,
Steven, you still - owe us a game of cards! - Garnet: Yeah, get in on this.
Steven: N-No! I don't want to play cards! - I want to talk about Peridot! -
Pearl: Oh, yes! - Well, everything is fine! - Steven: No, it's not! I know it's
not.
I know you you just don't want me to be scared, but just tell me the truth.
Garnet: Peridot is coming, and we don't know who or what she'll be coming with.
She's a modern gem with modern gem technology that's bound to overpower us.
Steven, the truth is we're scared.
Steven: We've been scared before, right? None of us know what's going to
happen, but that's okay.
We can figure things out together.
[all gasp.]

**** The Return ****
All: # We are the Crystal Gems # we'll always save the day Steven: # and if you
think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way # - # that's why the people # -
# of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and
Pearl # And Steven! 1x48 - "The Return" Steven: Give me the Oh, thanks.
- Eh, I saw you guys coming.
- Are you closing up - all by yourself? - Yeah.
- It's just me tonight.
- Wow.
That's a lot of responsibility for a kid your age.
Hey, your dad must really trust you.
- Don't patronize me, sir.
- Steven: See you, Peedee! So, like I was saying, Peridot's been shooting huge
robots here from space.
And when you smash them, - they explode into goo.
- That sounds scary.
You know, I'm not sure if Do you ever feel like this gem - stuff is too much
for you? - Steven: What do you Oh! [rumbling.]
What the hey was that?! Steven? - Steven: Is that a hand? - Pearl: The light
cannons - should be ready.
- Steven: Guys! Did you see that thing in the sky? Pearl: It's a ship.
We have to assume it's Peridot.
Garnet: Lapis told us she'd be coming with advanced - weapons and
reinforcements.
- It's happening.
Steven: I want to see.
Whoa! Garnet: Ready the light cannons! [grunts.]
Garnet: Steven, light 'em up.
Steven: If every pork chop were perfect we wouldn't have hot dogs.
- Garnet: No affect.
- What now? Garnet: We'll have to take them head on.
The whole town might be in danger.
Steven: I better make a call.
Time for some political favors.
[telephone rings.]
- Hello? - Steven: Mayor Dewey, it's me, - Steven Universe.
- Universe! What's this thing in the sky? As a politician, pointing - fingers
make me very nervous.
- Steven: Mayor Dewey, the whole town's in danger.
We have to evacuate the city.
Evacuate? Hmm.
Evacuate.
Could be tough.
Um I'll need a catchy slogan.
Eva-cu-ate! Eva-cu-ate! Eva-cu-ate! Eva-cu-ate! [crowd murmuring.]
People! I need everyone to consider evacuation.
Evacuation is something we all - depend on in times of trauma! - Steven: Oh,
hey.
That's a great idea, Dad.
You should leave with the rest of Is that my luggage? - Uh - Who wants to tell
him? Amethyst: Hey, I'm not good with this stuff.
Garnet: Steven, I know you don't think we trust you.
I know more often than not, we treat you like a human child.
But the truth is we rely on you.
Your voice inspires us, binds us, reminds us why we promised to protect the
planet.
You must now be that voice - for them.
- Peedee, come on! - When are we coming back?! - Ronaldo, help me with your
brother! Garnet: If anything happens, you need to be there to protect them,
like your mother once did.
- It's your destiny.
- Steven: I won't disappoint you.
Garnet: I know.
[engine turns over.]
We did everything we could.
All right.
Pull it together.
Eva-cu-ate.
Eva-cu-ate.
Steven: Maybe when Peridot gets to Earth, she'll see how nice all the people
are and she won't want to hurt anyone.
- Just like your mother.
- Steven: Yeah? Yeah.
But these other gems aren't like your mother.
They're not like Garnet, Amethyst, or Pearl.
They're not gonna start caring about people now.
They didn't the first time they - Steven: The first time they what? - I mean,
it was thousands of years ago.
It's It's not like I was there.
The gems should be telling you all this stuff, but I get it.
I mean, they don't want you - thinking of them like that.
- Steven: Like what? - Dad, like what? - Like aliens, Steven! - Aliens who
invaded Earth! - Steven: What? All they do is try to make up for it, but they
just can't forgive themselves.
Do you understand? Look, they were doing something awful to the planet, and
your mother couldn't stand it anymore.
She told me that's why she had to turn on her own kind.
She gave up everything just to stop what they started here and drive the
invading gems off of Earth.
Steven: So, sh-she saved the world.
- That's good! - Uh, no such thing as a good war, kiddo.
Gems were destroyed.
People, too.
In the end, your mother could only save a handful of her closest friends.
If it weren't for her shield man, I don't know.
Bu-but hey.
Let's look on the bright side! We're gonna drive by that waffle place in a
couple miles.
Steven: We got to go back! Turn the van around! No way! The gems don't want you
going back.
Steven: I know they're just trying to protect me, but I have to protect them.
I have Mom's shield.
They need me! - I need you, too! - Steven: Please, Dad! What if they get hurt?
Dad, turn around! Dad! Turn the van around, please! [tires screech.]
[horns honking.]
[grunts.]
Steven! - Steven: Dad - Yo, Greg! Are you and your kid okay? Yeah! Yeah.
We're fine.
We're fine.
[sighs.]
Steven: Dad, please.
I have to go back.
I have to.
They don't have my shield.
- Do you Do you understand? - Yeah.
Okay.
Just be careful or I'm gonna run fresh out of family.
Steven: Stay with everyone and keep them safe.
I'll figure out some way to get back to Beach City.
[growls.]
Steven: Oh, this'll work.
[dialing.]
[cellphone rings.]
- Come on.
Pick up.
- You have reached - the Maheswaran residence.
- Steven: Aw! Please leave a message after the beep.
And keep it short.
[beeps.]
Steven: Hey, Connie.
It's Steven.
Just seeing what you were up to.
[chuckles.]
Uh, don't know if you knew, but there's some crazy stuff going on with a giant
space hand, and we all might die, so, uh I guess call me back when you get
this, and talk to you soon! Uh, bye! [beeps.]
[roars.]
[gasps.]
Garnet: Fire! Steven: Stay here.
If something happens, Dad will need a new son.
Garnet: At least Steven is safe.
- Steven: Hey, guys! - Garnet: Steven! [both grunt.]
Amethyst: You came back! Pearl: What are you doing?! Get out of here! - Steven:
But - Garnet: It's too late.
Just stay behind us.
Steven: Uh That's them all right.
They're the ones that keep - breaking my machines.
- This is it? Jasper! They keep interfering with my work! [sighs.]
Looks like another waste of my time.
[gasps.]
Hey, get over here.
[gasps.]
- Steven: Lapis.
- This is their base? - Yes.
- Garnet: You need to leave immediately.
Amethyst: Yeah, step off! Pearl: This is not a gem-controlled planet.
Neither of you saw Rose Quartz? Oh, what a shame.
I hoped to meet her.
I was looking forward to beating her into the ground.
- Steven: Oh.
- But this is all that's left of her army? Some lost, defective Pearl, a puny,
overcooked runt, and this shameless display? Hmm.
What is that? - It calls itself the Steven.
- He's just a human.
He isn't a threat at all.
He He's not one of them! I know what a human is.
You don't need me for this.
- Just blast them with the ship.
- [sighs.]
Fine.
Garnet: Steven, get out of here! - Steven: No! - Garnet: I won't let you risk
your life.
Steven: But this is my home, - and you're all my family! - Firing.
Steven: I'm I'm a Crystal Gem, too! [gasps.]
That shield.
That symbol! [grunts.]
[groans.]
You! You have the power of Rose Quartz! - Now do you believe I needed an
escort? - Fire a barrage, wide spread! Rose, why do you look like that? Why are
you so weak? - Don't hurt him! - You knew about this! It wasn't relevant to the
mission! - Forget about the mission.
- What?! Yellow diamond needs to see this thing.
- Steven: Uh, uh - Good.
- Garnet: Steven, run! - Priming gem destabilizer.
[electricity crackles.]
[crack!.]
[gasps.]
[exclaims.]
I was there, you know, at the first war for this garbage planet.
I fought against your armies.
I respected your tactics.
But this - this is sick.
- Pearl: Unhand him! I don't get what you're planning, Rose, but look.
Your base is taken.
Your armies are ruined.
You have failed! [smack!.]

[muffled groaning.]
Steven: [gasps.]
[zap!.]
[warbling.]
Steven: Ew! [chuckles.]
Cool! Who-o-o-o-oa! [shudders.]
I'm out.
Whoo-hoo! Okay, where is everybody? Got to find 'em, got to find 'em, got to

Sapphire! - [gasps.]
Oh, it's just you.
- Steven: Lapis! - Lapis, I can get you out.
- Stop! - Steven: It's okay.
I can - No! I don't want your help.
Things are bad enough as it is.
I've already made too much trouble.
Once we get back to homeworld, they're going to decide what to do with us.
[groans.]
- I don't have time for this! - Steven: Wait! Steven, whatever you're doing,
just stop.
If we do everything they say, they might go easy on us.
Steven: But they're mean.
They hurt my friends.
They hurt my face.
- They've got you here in prison! - That's why we can't fight them.
Steven: That's why we have to fight them! I'll come back for you.
[vocalizing.]
- Steven: [gasps.]
- We can't leave yet! The whole point of coming here was to check on the
cluster.
Stop singing! Rose Quartz takes priority.
Get back to the bridge and set a course for homeworld.
"Go to Earth," they said.
"It'll be easy," they said.
[vocalizing.]
Steven: Hey.
I like your song.

Wait.
Are you gonna be able to beat her on your own? Garnet: It's okay, Steven.
I'm never alone.
Steven: Hmm.
Oh, great.

I'll just pretend I didn't know.
Amethyst: [laughs.]

[grunting.]
Don't think you've won.
You only beat me 'cause you're a fusion.
If I had someone to fuse with, I'd [rattling.]
Huh? [grunting.]
[gasps.]
Come here, brat! - Aw, don't fly off so soon.
- Steven: Lapis! Lapis, listen.
Fuse with me! - What? - How long did they keep you trapped here on this
miserable hunk of rock? These gems they're traitors to their homeworld.
They kept you prisoner.
They used you! This is your chance to take revenge! Come on.
Just say "yes.
" Steven: Lapis, don't do it.
Noooo! [all exclaim.]
[laughs evilly.]
[gasps.]
Huh? What?! [grunts.]
[straining.]
- What are you doing?! - I'm done being everyone's prisoner.
Now you're my prisoner! And I'm never letting you go! [gasps.]
No! [screams.]
Steven: Lapis! Let's stay on this miserable planet together! Garnet: Yikes.
They are really bad for each other.
[cellphone ringing.]
Steven: Uh hello? Connie: Steven, I got your message.
Are you okay? What's going on? Steven?

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e01 Episode Script ******
**** Full Disclosure ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x50 -
"Full Disclosure" That could have gone a lot worse.
Could have gone a lot better, too.
Steven, I got your message.
Steven? What happened?! We won! Is that Amethyst? Uh, what what's going on? You
said there's some kind of giant space hand and you all might die? Whoo-hoo!
Yeh-heh-heah! Connie! You're not going to believe what happened! Where do I
even start? - Whooooo! - It's been a madhouse over here! Amethyst! That's
enough celebrating! Huh? - Steven! - Dad! Connie, I have to go.
I promise I'll call you back.
Dad's back! Dad's back! Oh! Thank goodness! You're okay! I saw the spaceship
start to leave, and then it crashed, and I came back, and Ugh! Your eye.
But you're okay! I guess those jerks were no match for the Crystal Gems! No
way! They were superstrong! But you were able to beat them back? No.
They totally stomped us! This warrior Jasper was super-beefy and knocked me
unconscious.
Then they abducted me onto the ship because they wanted to take me away
forever.
And then we crashed the ship, and I almost died! - What did they want with you?
- They think I'm Mom.
A-Are more homeworld gems gonna come after you? I uh I don't know.
Maybe? Steven, I'm supportive and very proud of you, and I'll be right back.
Got to calm down.
Where's my Where's my relaxing-music CD?! This one? Wrong one! Stop! Eject!
Now, Connie, please don't freak out, but a giant laser hand tried to steal me
into space.
But it didn't.
It didn't.
I'm back, and everything is f-fine now.
Uh Um, Connie, funny story as it turns out, there's a lot more gems out there
than we thought, and I think they want to kill me? Hey, Connie, that that
message I left you was was just a dream.
Eh, she's too smart for that.
Yo! - Oh.
Hey, Ronaldo.
- Didn't you hear? Mayor Dewey's calling everyone back into the city.
We can go home now.
Oh.
I see.
You come up here to brood, too! - Brood? - Yes, Steven.
That's just what people like us do suffer quietly, shouldering the knowledge -
no one else can bear.
- Hmph.
As an aficionado of "the weird" yourself, you've probably noticed ordinary
people fear the cold, leaded anchor of the truth.
The abyss is no Sunday swan ride.
I know! My dad flipped out when I told him! Sounds typical.
But it's a good reminder.
This is no easy path we've chosen here.
There are sacrifices.
Look at them all down there, Steven.
It's our duty to let those simple people live out their simple lives without
ever knowing the burden of being friends with us.
At least we can be there for each other.
Is that giant hand from the sky sitting right in the middle of the beach?! I
got to get some of this for my blog! Everybody told me gem stuff's dangerous I
guess I didn't believe it until now dad always seemed apprehensive and now he's
really freaking out what do I do? I don't want that for you everybody tells me
life is precious on the planet Earth and that means you, and I have to protect
you what if somehow you get hurt? what do I do? I don't want that for you ooh-
ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh what am I going to
tell you? you're better off not knowing the trouble I'm in I don't want you to
worry about what I've just seen, about where I've just been you don't have to
be a part of this I don't think I want you to be you don't need this you don't
need me ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-
ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Aww, come on! No
whining.
We need to start cleaning up the debris.
Garnet's right.
People are already coming back into town.
We've got to keep them off the beach.
If any humans got access to gem technology, they could really hurt themselves.
Maybe we should shut them out for good.
You know, we did once have a fence.
Let's get a new one with barbed wire! This time, let's build a moat.
I could be the crocodile! Jazz hands.
- No.
- Why not?! You always say you'll be the crocodile, - but you never commit.
- No fence, either.
Garnet! Steven needs to see his father and his friends.
No, I don't! I can't keep clinging to the vestiges of my humanity.
It's time I got serious.
Steven, why is your communication device - playing that song? - It's Connie
trying to call me.
But I can't face her anymore.
So you're just going to ignore her forever? - It's the responsible thing to do.
- That's gonna be hard, 'cause she's coming up the steps right now.
What?! Ohhh! Hello Connie.
- Is Steven home? - No.
Is he okay? I'm just really worried.
He hasn't been answering his phone.
- What's going on? - Uhh I-I don't know.
I don't understand your human relationships.
So um goodbye.
Steven! Steven!! Steven? Steven! Are you in trouble? Is something wrong? Did I
do something wrong? Why are you avoiding me? Steven, I know you're here! Why
are you hiding from me?! "I don't want to be friends anymore"? - Steven? - I
can't be with you anymore.
- I have a destiny.
- Say it to my face! Say you don't want to be friends anymore! If you can do
that If you can do that, I'll leave you alone.
And I'll just go back to having no friends.
But I won't believe it until you say it to my face.
Well?! I still want to be friends! Steven, your eye! What happened to you? I
didn't want you to worry about it.
I've been worried sick all day.
What do you think I'm doing here? I just wanted to protect you.
Stop.
Just tell me everything.
So Lapis and Jasper are somewhere underwater.
Yeah.
And Peridot escaped while the ship was coming down.
- She could be anywhere.
- That is a lot to take in.
- Are you okay? - Are you okay? You're the one that's been through everything.
The least I could do is just listen.
I can't ask you to do that.
I want to, Steven.
I want to be a part of your universe.
Kiddo! There you are.
Oh, hey, Connie.
Do you need a ride home? Oh.
Dad.
Are you doing okay? I got it out of my system.
I'm back to being your cool dad.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e02 Episode Script ******
**** Open Book ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x51 -
"Open Book" - Ooh.
- Ahem.
So, what did you think of the ending? Uh I thought it was on page 917.
- I thought it was a disaster! - Uh All the books leading up to this seemed to
be taking on and subverting these witch tropes really self-aware about - being
a pastiche, you know? - Um But in the end, none of that even mattered.
Lisa and her talking falcon, rebels challenging the stifling traditions of the
magical bureaucracy I loved that.
Then her falcon turns into a human and they get married?! It completely dropped
all the anti-authoritarian stuff and described her wedding cake for 50 pages!
Yeah! That cake was worthy of 20 pages, tops! - There weren't even strawberries
on it! - I bet since the books got so popular, the publisher put pressure on
the author to water down the end for a larger audience appeal.
Unlike art, the real world can't always win against the iron chains of
authority.
- That's my theory, anyway.
- Hmm.
It's just disappointing, considering I invested extra money in the hardcover
copies with maps.
I wish I could give you a new ending.
The temple door it opened for me! I can make anything I want in there! I can
make us a new ending! Really? Well, what are we waiting for?! - Uh ta-da! -
Cool! This is my mom's room.
I can control it, like this.
I want a tiny, floating whale to give me some fin.
Unbelievable! How does it work? The room can make stuff out of clouds.
- We can make anything.
- Anything? How 'bout the infinity fair from book 4, with merchants from a
million lands selling goods from cultures long gone - and yet to be? - We
should probably keep it simple.
We don't want to overload the room.
How 'bout half the infinity fair? Oh.
That's still infinity.
Simple.
Okay.
Well, what really matters are the characters.
You should be Archimicarus.
Okay.
Room, I want to be a falcon! Oh, yeah.
Got to keep it simple.
Amazing! Okay, my turn.
Room, I want to be Lisa.
Do I need to be more specific? You were pretty general with the falcon thing.
Oh, sorry.
I guess the room only makes stuff when I want it.
Maybe this won't work after all.
Why don't you just have it make a costume shop? Oh, yeah! Good idea! I want a
costume shop! Wow! This place has everything even her childhood tunic! Wait.
You thought it was red? Yeah, the color of the setting sun! The sun sets black
over the mines, Steven.
Are you gonna be young Lisa? Well, if we're really reworking this thing, I'm
gonna make the ultimate Lisa with the best gear from every book.
Like, what if she never lost her iron sword? - Whoa! - And the cloak and the
clasp - are too signature not to do.
- For sure! And I always liked the dragon whisker boots from - the volcano
stuff in book 3.
- Are you almost done? - Wait a minute! - Come out! I want to see you! - Whoa!
You look awesome! - Thanks! Okay.
Let's do this.
So, at the end of the series, Lisa and her falcon familiar, Archimicarus, are
at the altar with a cleric about to get married.
But we don't want that ending.
So, instead hmm.
Uh I-I don't know.
What do you think? - Hmm.
What do you think? - Uh well h-how 'bout a different proposal, Lisa a business
proposal? We can start a business together and sell sell turkey legs to make
money to help out - our fellow rebel comrades! - Yeah, that's great! I want an
umbrella with that, if you would, room.
Turkey legs! Get your rebel turkey legs! Turkey legs! You think it's okay for
me - to eat this if I'm a falcon? - You are a bird of prey.
So, what should our next move be - as business partners? - You tell me.
Yeah? Oh.
Um Let's feed the wind lizard.
Look at this guy! - He totally looks like a rebel! - Wow! From book 4! Now, I
know he lives in the mountains, but he's just visiting because he heard about
these turkey legs.
Lisa, would you like - to do the honors? - Okay.
- He ate the bones! - Okay! I guess our business is a success.
- If you think so.
- So, what now? Didn't you have a bunch of ideas that it needed to be more -
anti-authority and stuff? - Sure.
Okay.
So we're we we're stopped by the authorities because because we're selling
without a permit and we're not old enough to drive a cart.
But these are, uh, free-range turkeys, and they didn't listen to anybody, and
that's what we're gonna do, right?! - Whatever you think.
- Really? All right.
And then I think they don't like that and they attack us.
You can't stop us! Geez! These guys are corrupt.
- What should we do about 'em, huh? - What do you think we should do? C-Come
on! I'm really trying here! How do you want the story to end? How do you want
the story to end? I don't know.
I just wanted to do this for you.
This isn't really like you.
I I don't want you to just - do what I want.
- Uh Uh you want me to not - d-do what you want? - Connie, are you all right? I
want what you want what you want want want want want want - want want - I want
a tiny floating whale to give me some fin.
I want a costume shop! I want to see you! want want want want want want want -
I-I created you.
- want want want You're not Connie! I must have left the real Connie back at
the costume shop! Sh-She could be anywhere! No, no, no, no, no! I'm done! I'm
done playing! Why didn't you disappear with everything else?! You told me not
to do what you wanted.
Ohh.
- Where is Connie?! - Steven! - Steven! - Connie? C-Connie?! Is that you?!
Please let me go.
- I want to find the real Connie! - You told me you wanted It doesn't matter!
Please don't follow me.
I don't want you to follow me! Cart! Uh Uh, wind lizard! Uh Uh Uh Connie, can
you hear me?! Steven? Steven! Connie! I'm almost there! Just a little bit
furthe Please! I don't want you! I want the real Connie! I know what you really
want.
- I know how you really feel.
- Steven?! Ah, Steven, finally! There you are.
Ugh! Ugh! Help! Keep away from him! I know you like her.
- And I know you want her to like you, too.
- No! Don't listen! That's why you can't tell her the truth, but you want to! -
Ow! - You want to tell her! - No! - Get off him! - Tell her, Steven! - I Tell
her! I liked the ending of the book! - What? - I-I-I thought it was sweet that
Lisa and Archimicarus got together in the end.
They were always so thoughtful towards each other, and I was so happy when they
found the spell to make him human, and I loved every page about the cake! I
wanted to draw a picture of it! I'm I'm sorry I pretended not to like it.
I just I just didn't want - you to think less of me.
- Ahh.
That's better.
Do Do you think I'm a bad person for liking the ending? Of course not.
I Steven, it's just a book.
But you really care about it.
- I care about you more.
- Even though I liked the wedding? Oh, of course you liked the wedding.
You're Steven.
You love schmaltz.
You make a good point, but don't you remember how Archimicarus - cried in book
3? - I thought that was because - they lost the sword.
- No! She almost fell into the volcano! - He was worried about her.
- But she had access to frost spells.
Yeah, but Archimicarus didn't know that.
- Even birds can fall in love.
- I guess you could read it that way.

we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 1x52 -
"Joy Ride" Do we really have to get every piece? - Yes! - Yes.
Having a wrecked gem ship lying around is too dangerous.
We've got to take care of it all of it.
And we'll need to start looking for Peridot's escape pod, too, assuming she
even made it to Earth.
- We've got lots of work ahead of us.
- On it.
Whoa, that's a big one.
Steven? Steven? - Steven! - Huh? - Yo.
- Hey, Steven.
Welcome back to Earth.
- What? Who told you? - You looked a million miles away, man.
Oh.
Sorry.
I was zoning out.
We were about to go chill at a parking lot - and freak out some squares.
- You should come with.
Oh, but I-I don't really have anything against squares.
- I like all basic shapes.
- Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
You got that much-needed counter-point to our cynical world-view.
You have to come.
- It's good energy flow.
- Sorry, guys.
I've got a lot of important gem work to do.
- Maybe later.
- Aww.
- Bummer.
- Well, we'll catch you later, then.
The calluses on my hands have calluses.
The working man's burden is truly a heavy one.
Pizza rain.
But no pizza clouds.
Wha What are you guys doing here? And why are you making it pizza rain? I only
wanted to see you laughing in the pizza rain.
- Is that a reference to something? - Come on.
It's time to hang out.
You can't hang out at night.
Night is for dreaming.
Night's whatever you want it to be.
- Time's an illusion.
- Hmm.
- Aren't you done working for the day? - Mm.
Yeah, okay.
- Let's hang out.
- Nice.
But first we need to deliver the rest of this pizza to Mr.
Smiley.
Whoo! Wind in your face - that's what I'm talkin' about.
- Breathe deep, Steven.
This is the smell of freedom.
Freedom smells like pepperoni.
- That's just the car.
- You know what food definitely doesn't smell like freedom? - Fish.
- Why fish? - Uh-oh.
Here we go.
- I just don't get what's wrong with wanting to be a deejay.
But my step-dad was all on my case again today, sayin' Ugh.
I'm just like, "I don't want to be a fisherman.
Everyone knows you can't rave in a raincoat, step-dad.
" At least he only bugs you about one thing.
My dad's got to say something about everything I do 'cause I'm the mayor's son.
And I'm like, "you can't tell me what to do.
I'm the mayor's" Wait.
Puh-lease! You're just walking in cake with that talk.
You guys don't even know what bad is until you have a sister.
But I don't know why I have to spell it out that I'm the evil twin and she's
the good one.
Don't ask me to help you with your homework.
- I'm at some metal concert.
- Family stuff is tricky.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
A few months back, my dad and the gems grounded me from TV.
- Bummer.
- That's the worst.
- No way! - And then I found out that the gems are alien rebels and that there
are other gems out in space that want us dead 'cause they think we're traitors.
And they tried to take me hostage 'cause they think I'm my mom.
And maybe I kinda am? I wish I could talk to Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl about
it, But I think they kinda blame me for my mom not being around.
- That's heavy.
- I guess.
But you always seem so upbeat.
You're a real champ, Steven Universe.
Yeah, man.
I'd turn to fishing in a heartbeat if it meant not dealing with tha that! -
Look at that! - What?! What did I hit it? - What is it?! - Gloooowing.
- We got to check it out.
- I'm down.
All right.
Hold on.
That's as bright as like 600 glow sticks.
Peridot's escape pod! Okay, everybody step back! This is a gem machine and
could be extremely dangerous.
- Check it out.
- What are you doing? Boom! Whoa, stop! Peridot might still be in there! Peri-
what? - This biz is empty.
- It looks so busted.
- You need to get away from there! - Whoa! You need to relax.
It's not doing anything.
It's not just the pod.
This means Peridot is just out there somewhere, - trying to hurt the Earth.
- Not cool.
Earth forever.
Here come the rocks.
Steven, come take a selfie with me and this thing.
- No, Jenny, I'm serious.
- So am I.
- Sour Cream, what about you? - Sure.
I'm down for whatever.
- Buck? - Nah.
I like to just experience the moment for what it is sometimes.
Plus, the lighting is weird.
Ugh, okay.
Steven? - Last call.
- Mmmm.
I got funny stickers! These are so good! - How do I look? - You look great!
Look, stay right there.
I wanna take one mor - Steven, get in it! - W-What? Just for a second! One
picture.
Okay, ready.
Three, two Wha - Dude! - Oh, my gosh, Steven! Wha? This is so cool! Whoa! Whoa!
- Steven! - Whoa! How are you doing that? Uh I think it listens to what my
hands do.
I really shouldn't be playing with this.
I have to take this back to the temple immediately.
No way.
You just got it working! Come on, aren't you your own mom? You can do whatever
you want.
Yeah, you got to do some donuts in that thing.
At least a dozen.
Baker's dozen.
Seriously, Steven, you've been under a lot of pressure.
Don't you think you deserve to have a little fun? Whoo! Hey! You really got the
hang of that thing, huh? Yeah! It always hooks to the left.
Whoa! I should really get it back to the gems, though.
- No! No! - No, no, no, no.
Or right after I jump that haystack! - Yeah! Come on! - Yeah! Do it! - Mess it
up! - Wreck it, Steven! Go, Steven! - Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! Whoo! I'm okay.
It's not actually so bad if you just give it a little Steven? Guys? Steven!
What's going on? Guys, can you hear me? I knew it! That flare led us right to
the escape pod! What's going on here? - Help! Help us! - Over here! Garnet,
Amethyst, Pearl! We'll save you, humans! I can't believe it.
Peridot's still inside.
She's probably weak from the landing.
Don't hold back.
Got it! - No! No! - No! Whoa! You got a lot of nerve taking refuge here, of all
places! - Garnet? - But I don't know where you get off attacking defenseless
humans in your deadbeat escape pod.
Garnet! It's me, Steven! Can you hear me? Garnet! And if you think you're safe
here, well, I got news for you.
You lost! - Now - Garnet! Garnet! Garnet! stay off my planet! Stop! Steven's in
there.
- Oh, Steven! - Steven, what were you doing?! You found Peridot's escape pod,
and you didn't come get us immediately? - Dude, we almost wrecked you.
- Steven, this is unacceptable.
I'm very disappointed in you.
You're right.
- Hey! Cut him some slack.
- It's not his fault! - Just let him be a deejay! - Wha? We just wanted Steven
to have some fun.
I don't know what's going on with aliens trying to abduct him and him being his
own mom, but it sounds like he's got a lot on his mind.
I'm sure whatever you're having him do is important, but everyone needs a break
once in a while.
He's just a kid.
Oh, maybe we have been a little hard on him.
He did just break us out of space jail.
Steven.
You're ungrounded from TV.
I'm invincible!

We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 2x01 -
"Say Uncle" Shield.
No, not bubble shield! Ugh.
What am I doing wrong? The gems can all summon their weapons.
Why can't I?! Isn't there somebody who can help me?! Wha Huh? Huh? Wha Good
morning! Bravo! This guy sure knows how to make an entrance! What do you think,
Mr.
Dolphin? Oh, my gosh! Uncle Grandpa! You're really here! I can't believe it! I
mean, I literally can't believe it.
How is this even possible?! Don't worry, bro none of this is canon.
But this is! _ Oh, no! Our ship! So, I hear your belly's being a bit of a
bummer.
Yeah.
I've been trying to pull my shield out of my gem all morning.
Hmm.
Well, let's take a look-see.
You should make sure you get this thing polished at least twice a year.
So, do you think you can help me? I just want to be able to protect my friends.
Hmm.
Yep.
It's the belly blues.
- I've definitely seen this before.
- Really? I was there! Don't you remember? Uh Whoa! Hey! It's a rad new cartoon
picture show! Hey! Hey! Hi, there! - Aww! It was funnier last time.
- Good morning? - I don't remember that at all.
- So, your shield only comes out when you need to protect yourself.
- Yeah? - Well, then you just need something to protect yourself from like this
cool mega super awesome rocket launcher.
Uh, Uncle Grandpa, this doesn't seem safe.
Don't worry, kid I'm wearing a helmet.
- Anything? - No.
Then how about a bee-zooka? Or a snake shooter? - Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! - Or the bee-
zooka again? Hmm.
Still nothin'.
Oh, I know! Amethyst, have you seen Steven this morning? Yep.
He's hanging out with some weirdo.
I think he's trying to vaporize Steven.
Steven! No, not bubble shield! Hmm.
I would have sworn a doomtastic death ray of dastardly destruction would have
worked.
You want to try the bees again? Steven! What's going on? Who is this stranger?
He's not a stranger! He's Uncle Grandpa! "Uncle Grandpa?" So, that would make
him Greg's brother - and father? - That would explain a lot.
That's right! He's not just your Uncle Grandpa, Steven he's everyone in the
world's Uncle Grandpa! And when he comes to town, you're sure to have a fun
time! We're in space! Ugh! Ee-ee-ee! Ohh! Ugh! Agh! My head is on backwards! -
Gem huddle! - Obviously we're dealing with some superpowerful, reality-warping
entity.
He could be a danger to the fabric of space itself.
I don't know, guys.
Heh.
I kind of like him.
Hey! What are you guys talking about? Are you forming a secret club? Can we
join too? Um, Uncle Grandpa - Good morning.
- Yes.

must destroy you.
- What?! - Bad morning.
Wait! No! You guys, don't hurt him! Run away! Come on, kid.
Let's go! Oof! Wh-y-y-y-y-y?! I'm sorry! They're not usually like this! Quick!
Belly bag, we need a plot hole! Sure thing, Uncle Grandpa! Where are we? Good
morning! Now, where'd I put that little kid? Oh, yeah! Good morning! Oh, let me
give you a hand there.
Whoa.
Where am I? - Welcome to the UGRV! - The wha? The Uncle Grandpa recreational
vehicle.
Oh, cool! My dad lives in a van, too! - Did you used to be a rock star? - I'm
still a rock star, kid.
Uncle Grandpa #2: Hey, Steven, I'll give you the tour! Wow! It's huge! You
could fit a million vans in here! Actually, it's more like 40 or 50 vans.
See? Oh, hey.
It's just me, Pizza Steve just the coolest and tastiest Steve who ever lived.
Hi, Pizza Steve! I'm a Steve, too - Steven Universe.
- Steve-n Universe? Come on, Uncle G.
I've got two rules No more than 40 or 50 vans and only one Steve allowed! -
Yeah, but this Steven is special.
- Yeah! He's a Crystal Gem! - Good morning, Mr.
Gus.
- What's up, Uncle Grandpa? Whoa! Mr.
Gus! How do you know about me? I have a comprehensive knowledge of all magical
denizens of the multiverse.
I know all about the Crystal Gems.
Come here, man.
Check this out.
I even made my own gemsona.
My gem is on my tail, and my weapon is a frying pan.
- Nice line work, Mr.
Gus! - That's really cool, Mr.
Gus.
- I wish I was as cool as your drawing.
- Something wrong? Steven doesn't know how to summon his shield.
You don't say? Oh, that's simple.
Steven's powers are maternal.
Control of his gem is based on emotional clarity.
His shield only comes out when he's feeling extreme emotions of Hey, Mr.
Gus! I fixed your drawing! Hey! Why didn't you do that on a new layer?! Oh, hi,
giant realistic flying tiger! You got any advice for Steven? I'm not gonna tell
him that.
That only works on cats.
Well, now what? We just sit here until something happens.
- Something happened! - Whoa! Burp! Hoo! There's gotta be some way out of here.
We'll never escape! This is our new home! - Pearl, you're overreacting.
- I'm not overreacting! Ugh! Hey, where's Steven? Looking for me, Pizza Steven
Universe? - That's not my baby! - Aw, nice! Whoa! Hold on! - Pizza! - Don't eat
Pizza Steve! Ew.
Okay.
I'm ready for this episode to end.
Ugh! I'm sorry I couldn't help you learn to use your shield, Steven.
It's okay, Uncle Grandpa.
I had a lot of fun today.
- Steven! - Get away from that man! He's a monster! Hey, cut it out, guys! He's
down enough already! Oh, good morning! That smarts.
Finish him! No! Don't hurt him! Sto-o-o-o-p! Whoa! I did it, Uncle Grandpa! I
really did it! Yay! Protecting him activated Steven's powers?! He must really
care about this stranger.
I hope he didn't care about that pizza.
Listen! It was a big, weird surprise when Uncle Grandpa showed up here today.
We've never met anyone like Uncle Grandpa.
But you can't just attack people you don't understand.
You have to stick up for them and listen to what they have to say.
You guys always do that for me.
Steven, you're right.
How could I be so blind?! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - I also apologize for Pearl.
- Thank you.
You've taught us a valuable lesson, Uncle Grandpa.
Welp, I think my work here is done.
Bye-bye! Remember, kids don't be afraid to be superweird.
Steven and I have got your back.
See with eyes unclouded by hate and always remember to say "good morning!" Boy,
that sure makes my eyes hurt.
Now let's see here.
Dexter, Dee Dee, Blossom, Bubbles, Ed, Edd, Eddy, Billy, Mandy, Mac, Juniper,
Swat Kats, Flapjack, Finn.
Ah, Steven! Now who's next? _

**** Story for Steven ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 2x02 -
"Story for Steven" Whoo! Go, Dad! See? What'd I tell you? I may be losing my
hair, but the magic's still there.
Hmm? Who's with you in this old picture? - That's my pal Marty.
- You've never told me about him.
Yeah, he's just an old amigo from way back when.
- He's dead to me.
- Who was he? He was my manager back when I first met your mom.
I've told you that whole story, haven't I? Not the version with Marty.
Geesh.
Then it's story time.
Sit back.
Get comfy.
- I didn't mean that comfy.
- Story for Steven! Okay, okay.
This is the tale of how your father met your mother.
Now including Marty.
Some say I have no direction that I'm a light-speed distraction but that's a
knee-jerk reaction still this is the final frontier everything is so clear to
my destiny I steer this life in the stars is all I've ever known stars and
stardust and infinite space is my only home but the moment that I hit the stage
thousands of voices are calling my name and I know in my heart it's been worth
it all of the while and as my albums fly off of the shelves handing out
autographed pics of myself this life I chose isn't easy but sure is one heck of
a ride at the moment that I hit the stage I hear the universe calling my name
and I know deep down in my heart I have nothing to fear and as the solar wind
blows through my hair knowing I have so much more left to share a wandering
spirit who's tearing its way through the cold atmosphere I fly like a comet
soar like a comet crash like a comet I'm just a comet Thanks for coming,
everybody.
I'm Mr.
Universe.
If you liked what you just heard, go check out our merch table.
My manager, Marty, can hook you up with CDs and T-shirts.
Oh, wait.
He's not there.
I guess I'm going over there now.
- "Space train to the cosmos.
" - Yeah! One-way ticket and I'm ready to ri-i-de Oh.
But how will you get back? - Back? - Back to Earth? - I'm never coming back.
- Ugh, that's awful! - This is your home.
- Uh You want that? You can have it! - Hmm? - Oh, and it comes with a free T-
shirt! You'll probably need a bigger one.
I've got an extra extra-large in my van.
Stay right there! Starchild! Meet Vidalia.
Nice van.
Really living the high life.
- So, how was the show? - It was great! One person showed up! Oh! I have to
give her this free T shirt.
Greg! You can't give stuff away for free! What about my 75%? Are you worth
nothing? - No.
- That's right! I'm gonna make us both rich! And as far as these saltwater saps
know, we already are! So let's live it up before we hit the road, all right?
Next stop Empire City! You know I'll catch up with you.
- Maybe she's over there? - Whooo? Oh, just some giant mysterious lady with
enormous pink hair.
You haven't seen anyone - like that around, have you? - Sure have, pal.
- Wh-Where? - Well, uh if I told you any more, I'd have to kill you!! Hoo hoo
hoo! Hey! Wait! Hold on a sec! Whoa! Ugh.
This long-haired human was talking to me over by the fence.
- It spoke to you? - He was asking about Rose.
Look! There he is! - Yo.
- Amethyst! Wait! It's you! I've never seen this one around here before.
- Oh, I really like your hair.
- Amethyst, leave him be! You don't know where he's been! I'm very sorry about
this, uh, you? - Whoa! - Oh, Amethyst.
- You're with a human.
- He followed me over the fence.
What should we do? - State your purpose.
- Uh, I was kind of looking for the mysterious pink lady, kind of really tall,
- lots of big, curly hair.
- See? - He's talking about Ro - I don't know how - to make him go away.
- I'll just throw him - back over the fence.
- Huh? Oh! Who-o-a! Excellent idea.
Humans should stay on the other side of the fence like the sign says.
- Please! No throwing! - Wait! - Mr.
Universe? - It's you.
Whoa.
Ow! Are you all right? - You know this human?! - He was playing a concert on
the beach, and I couldn't help myself.
No one could ignore the Universe.
Oh! I brought you this! It's the free T-shirt that - came with your free CD! -
Why, thank you! His gimmick is space! Hey, play something, music man! - Better
make it good.
- Aw, man.
I'm working on this awesome new set.
It's gonna kill at my next show.
"Next show"? Aw, geez.
What time is it? - Night time? - Yeah, Marty's probably looking for me.
We're supposed to hit the road.
It's a big show in a big city, and I didn't drop out of - community college for
nothing! - What? Well, you better hurry.
You don't want to miss your - space train to the cosmos.
- Okay! I'll see you later! Uh, I hope the stars will align - for us to meet
again! - I'm sure they will! Bye, music man! I can sing.
What? Man, Greg, you really missed out.
Vidalia's friends were wild and crazy.
- Glad that town wasn't a total waste.
- I met some wild ladies, too.
They change shape and appear out of beams of light.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Save the poetry for Empire City, starchild.
We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
I'm serious, Marty.
- Something's going on back there.
- Are you nuts? Just wait till you see what's ahead of us.
It's fame! Hey, what's jammed in your tape deck? You been putting pennies in
here, you weirdo? Play something for me, Starchild.
Do you believe in destiny? close your eyes and leave the rest to me Snore!
You're gonna put people to sleep with that! Where's this schlock coming from?
I-I just can't stop thinking about that woman at the show.
Oh, here we go.
How big was she? - 8 feet tall massive hair.
- See, Greg, this is your problem.
You want one huge woman when you can have - multiple smaller ones.
- Ugh.
- Marty, women are people.
- Just follow my lead.
I'm gonna get you everything you want.
- What if I want to go back? - What?! What if I want to go back and be with
her?! No one cares about your feelings, Greg! They're making you lose sight of
what's really important! Watch the road! Why do you always decide what's
important? Because I'm your manager, and you're just some spaced-out kid! I'm
taking you to the city, and you're gonna play, and you're gonna like it.
Maybe you'll even make me some money for once.
Get out of my van.
- Sit down, Greg.
- I said, get out of my van! Ooh! What are you doing?! You're making a huge
mistake! Hey! Are you in there? I can play for you now! I even revamped my
awesome set! This one's for you, mystery woman! Do you believe in destiny?
close your eyes and leave the rest to me do you believe in fantasy? I have to
when it's right in front of me, oh what are you doing here? in the real world
what are you doing here? so close I could touch you what are you doing here?
and what are you doing to me-e-e? Oh! You're wearing the shirt.
- Please go away.
- I-I'm sorry.
Did I? You're awfully cute.
And I really want to play with you.
But your life is short, and you have dreams.
I won't let you give up - on everything you want.
- Well, that's gonna be a problem.
- Huh? - You're everything I want! - What are you smiling about? - You loved
her! Come here, you! - Rah! - Oh, man.
- Marty was the worst! - Oh, yeah.
He was awful! But I guess I owe him a lot.
- He made it easy for me to stay.
- I'm glad you did.
Yeah, me too.

- Oh! Uh, of course.
- All right! Ha ha! Guitar Dad teaches you guitar! - What is that? - It's my
dad! He's going to start teaching guitar lessons, and he made me his P.
R.
department.
- What's that stuff in his mouth? - Those are his teeth.
What are the lightning bolts for? Uh well, I-I was trying to show that dad
really rocks on the guitar, and Then there should be rocks falling out of the
guitar.
I hear what you're saying, but it's too late for notes.
This is permanent marker.
- Mm-hmm! - What's that cute flyer for, Steven? It's for my dad! He'll teach
you guitar.
You guys want to sign up? My dad's really good! Maybe I'll stop by and check it
out.
Here, let me give you a flyer and - Welcome to the big donut! - Hey, Buck! Oh!
What? Buck, Buck, Bu-u-u-u-ck! Ha ha! What's going on, man? What can we get for
you today? - Can I get a caprese salad? - Oh, sorry, Buck, - we only serve don

Oh, you missed.
Ho! I think it's swell you're returning to the family business, son! Gonna help
the old man get re-elected again, eh? - Aw, son! - Ugh! It's not for campaign
stuff, dad.
Steven and I are making art.
Art! Art, huh? I don't understand it myself, but a boy's got to have interests
and ambitions! This stuff can be used to make T-shirts? Oh, yeah, I've got all
the latest, state-of-the-art screen-printing equipment from years of
campaigning and other some-such mayorly things.
Like this week, I'm commemorating a bench! "Welcome to 'Bench' City"? Thrifty!
- Dad, you can't use this! - Why not? You know, I got to "gank dat" youth vote,
boyeeee! - Dad, stop.
- What's this? What have you got there? I haven't seen this in years! Remember
when you drew this, Buck? You couldn't wait to show it off to all your little -
montessori friends.
- Okay, dad! Thanks for all your help.
- See you later! Bye.
- All right, kids! I mean, peace in the Middle East, Holmes! - So cool.
- Let's just get started already.
- Swag.
- Now everyone's gonna want lessons from dad! This is bigger than your dad,
Steven.
It's art.
And it's gonna flood the public consciousness.
Well, let's start handing them out! Too simple.
We need to get controversial.
We need to create Boom! a scene.
Scanning for targets.
T-shirt cannon loaded and ready! Beep, beep, beep bibibibi! - Sour Cream
sighted! - Wom wom wom wom wom.
Get ready! Take aim! - And.
.
- Womp womp womp womp! What in the world? Oh, this is the coolest thing I've
ever been hit in the head with! Ronaldo spotted.
Take aim! Whoa! What the heck?! Huh? Whoa! Weird! Some kind of extraterrestrial
space dad guitar shirt? So, you've finally decided to make first contact, huh?
Where are you?! Lars sighted.
Take aim! Youch! What the What is this garbage? Buck made this? This is
hilarious! Thanks, Buck! Cheers! Buck, this was such a good idea! I don't know
why we didn't collaborate on a project sooner! This will make my dad so happy!
I can't wait to see the look on his face when I stop by later.
Yeah.
Should be good for a laugh.
Huh? Why would it be good for a - Girl! Check out my new shirt! - It's really
cute! - Where'd you get it? - I don't know.
It just landed in front of me when I was out walking.
Well, if I were you, I wouldn't wear some random shirt that just fell out of
the sky.
What if there were bugs in it? Relax! Who cares where it came from? This shirt
is the funniest thing I've seen in my life! Looks like our shirt has a really
good buzz going.
Yeah, but I think they think it's a joke.
Heh.
The only thing that's important is that they're talking about it.
- That's how real art works.
- Oh, well, I-I guess you're right.
- Uh, how's this? - Ha ha ha.
So bad.
Okay! Let's get started with the first lesson! Have a seat and grab a Where you
going? Oh, uh, I guess he got an important text or something.
- How's it been going today? - Really great! Lots of people have been coming
by, thanks to your - T-shirts, little guy.
- That's great, dad! - I'm really glad I could help - Yoo-hoo! Guitar Dad! I
just wanted to say I think you're wonderful and hilarious! Uh thank you? Huh.
That's kind of strange.
- What is? - Well, lots of people have stopped by, but no one's taken a lesson
yet.
- What? Really?! - Ah, maybe they're just checking out the scene before they
come back to get a real lesson! - Buck! - Hey, there's my main man.
The shirts aren't working, Buck! Yeah, they are.
People love 'em.
But nobody wants guitar lessons from my dad! - That's not the point.
- What?! Then what is the point? The point is, it's an amazing shirt.
Aw, my drawing's not that good.
- Yeah, no.
It's terrible.
- What?! That's what's so great about it.
Your work is so naive.
You really love your dad.
It's funny.
I I don't want to make these shirts anymore.
Too bad, Steven.
It's so current, you can't stop it.
I'm a taste maker, and I'm gonna keep making tastes - forever.
- Forever? Well, forever, after I go to my dad's lame bench commemoration.
Peace.
- Garnet! Pearl! Amethyst! - Steven! - What is it?! - Whoa, where's the fire?!
It's an emergency! You have to help me get rid of all the shirts and stop Buck
from making more! Have the shirts come to life and possessed the bodies - of
their wearers? - No, they just Are people catching on fire when they put on -
the magic shirts? - No, no, th-they're just Are the shirts destroying the
wearers' wills to continue on in this mortal coil, - thereby shutting down
Beach City?! - No!! They're They're just using my art in a way I don't agree
with.
- Oh.
- Eh, we'll pass.
What?! But But, I really need your help! Steven, this sounds like a very
abstract problem.
It's not something we can punch.
You must learn to help yourself.
That's how you become stronger.
- Good point, good point.
- Oh, absolutely.
- But! - You'll figure something out, Steven! Yes, why not dust off those
conflict-resolution skills! Let your problem be known.
Then you can work towards an understanding.
Oh, I'll make him understand.
- I'll make them all understand! - Eh, he'll be fine.
Okay.
Is everyone here? Hello! I was supposed to write a speech to, um, commemorate
this, uh, new bench, but what had happened was I ran out of printer ink in my
printer that I keep at home.
So, I went to the store and wouldn't you know it? They didn't carry the brand I
was looking for, so - Bye! - I called up a buddy of mine who owed me a few
political favors, and he wasn't home! Look out! No! I've been shirt! Buck did
you make this? This shirt is genius! This is way funnier than Guitar Dad! This
bench is actually pretty comfortable.
Anyone else stop by for lessons today? So far, no, but, I'm sure it'll pick up
tomorrow! Yeah, I'm sure it will.
This is for you, by the way.
This is the last one, so it's super-limited edition! Aw, sweet! Thanks, Steven!
Yo, Steven, just wanted to say, uh, I'm sorry for what - I did and uh - It's
okay, Buck.
You don't have to say any more than that.
You're a cool cat, Steven Universe.
Hey, Mister "U.
"? You want to take a picture with me or some junk? No way, man.
I want a lesson from Guitar Dad!

- My hands are polite.
- Oh.
Garnet.

- Howdy.
- Whatcha up to, Garnet? I was just at the bottom of the ocean checking for
signs of Lapis and Jasper.
- Any luck? - Nope.
Wow.
How were you able to swim to the bottom of the ocean? It was easy.
I'm a really good swimmer.
Excuse me.
Uh, Steven, why did you receive so many boxes of sea pals? Uh, I ordered one at

pierced the deepest artery of my being you.
You are a cardiac surgeon, and I am your transplant patient.
And you stand poised over my chest, holding my still-beating heart, hesitating,
waiting, wondering.
So I implore you to join me for dinner, or maybe lunch if you want to keep it
casual, next Friday at the Crab Shack.
I await your response, as the camellia awaits the rise of the Moon.
'Cause, you know, it only blooms at night and stuff.
"Love, Jamie.

- Nope.
- Why not? - Garnet is already in a relationship.
- Wait, really? Well, yeah.
She is a relationship.
Oh, you mean, 'cause she's a fusion.
Ruby and Sapphire are so close that they can't stand to be apart.
So I guess this date with Jamie is out of the question.
Three's a crowd.
But, guys, Jamie put so much thought into this letter! It would be rude not to
reply! Okay, Garnet, it might be best to play off the tone of his letter and
start off with something like, "dearest Jamie.
" - Okay, go for it, Garnet.
- Start with the letter "N.
" - Okay.
What next? - Uh the letter "O.
" Uh, okay.
You can just say the whole word - instead of spelling it out.
- Period.
So, "N," "O," period? - Ohhh.
- I think we'll need more than that.
"The end.
Forever.
And even after that.
" - "Yours truly, Garnet.
" - Hmm.
At least it's honest and to the point.
Where do you think he could be? I don't know.
He could be dropping off mail - halfway around the world by now.
- There he is! Jamie.
Oh, hey, Connie and Steven.
You guys come out here to stare at the ocean and think about life, too? Uh no?
- We came to, uh - Yeah.
Life is crazy.
One day, you're right here in Beach City, delivering mail, and then the next
thing you know, you're on a bus to Kansas following your dreams of becoming an
actor.
"Follow your dreams," they said.
But no one said anything about all the rejection and sadness there was to be
found.
So many auditions day after day.
So much rejection day after day.
That's why I came back.
One more rejection would have destroyed my fragile heart.
Sorry.
Sometimes, I get caught up in the drama zone, you know? Yeah, right.
Drama zone.
Oh, by the way, we have something for y No, we don't! How can we give this
letter to Jamie now? - He might get upset.
- Hmm.
We can make adjustments.
We can match Jamie's poetic language and let him down easy.
I watched some episodes of a torrid soap opera once, so I'm confident that I
get the gist of romance.
Ehhh There! "Dear Jamie you, dear camellia, expectantly await the light of my
moon, yet my light is more of a scorching, wilting, dry desert heat.
And as your metaphorical surgeon, it is with a heavy heart that I urge you to
seek a second opinion.
- I return your heart to you" - "Also, your hair is nice.
" "Hair is nice.
Yours, but not really, Garnet.
" Perfect.
Mission accomplished.
Garnet! - Huh? - Garnet! Where art thou, my sweet scorching sunbeam? Oh, no!
Garnet! I read thine letter, and I understand! Thou hast returneth mine heart!
What?! No, that's not what Garnet, you like my hair just as I adore yours.
- Come to me, Garnet.
- Jamie! Ah, young master Steven! Pray thee, where is Lady Garnet? She She's n
She's not coming.
But I've come to proclaim my love for my woman! No, Jamie, you don't
understand! I Garnet! You've come! You can tell Steven about all the beautiful
things you wrote to me in your missive.
- I didn't write that.
- But it's all right here! Stained with tears of joy and now also rain.
Mmm Connie and I wrote that letter, Jamie! - What? - I'm so sorry, Jamie.
We just wanted to let you down easy.
Wilst thou not scorch me, my darling sun? I am not, nor will I ever be,
interested.
Go away! M-My panache! Jamieeee! Ooh, boy.
I feel so bad for poor Jamie.
Yeah.
But I'm sure he'll bounce back from this in no time.
He's probably gonna show up - with the mail any moment now.
- Yeah.
Excuse me, kids.
I'm looking for the home of Steven Universe? I'm the home of Steven Universe.
Hey, you're Greg's boy.
I thought Jamie was pulling my leg when he told me you were living over here.
W-Wait.
Where is Jamie? Aw, that poor kid's emotions have been destroyed.
- What?! - Yeah, he's a mess! Said he couldn't bear to deliver mail on this
route again after having his love spurned.
He said it just like this.
Like Like, when he's in the drama zone.
Then he clenched his fist and closed his eyes like this.
Full of drama to the end.
Anyway, here's a book of coupons.
Have a good one! Rah! - You look sad.
- We really messed up this time.
Because of us, Jamie's feeling lower than ever.
- We've shattered the man! - He'll never love again! - I'll go talk to him.
- But your words will destroy him! Can't you just, like, zap his brain so he
forgets any of this ever happened? - Jamie.
- Garnet.
I didn't mean to upset you.
- Then will you go out with me? - No! But I've loved you since the moment I saw
you.
Love at first sight doesn't exist.
Love takes time, and love takes work.
At the very least, you have to know the other person.
And you literally have no idea who or what I am.
But I bloom for you, like like a camellia under moonlight.
No, you don't! You make a very convincing lovesick fool.
You convinced these children.
You even convinced yourself.
You're a fantastic actor.
- What am I supposed to do now? - Start with local theater.
- Are you okay? - Yeah.
That was some pretty solid advice.
Were those more letters you wrote to Garnet? No, that was the mail I was
supposed to deliver on my last route.
- We'll help you pick it all up.
- Thanks.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e08 Episode Script ******
**** Reformed ****
We are the Crystal Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - #
believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! 2x08 -
"Reformed" Sniffling croissant! You really know me, internet.
- Hey, guys! - Yeah, Steven? You guys should take this online quiz I found.
It tells you what It tells you what character you are - from "Crying Breakfast
Friends"! - Eh why? It's just fun to see yourself as a cartoon character.
Like weeping eggcup, who's neurotic and uptight, or pining grapefruit, the
sensitive older one who wishes he was a better role model.
Uh, maybe we can do that thing after we've fixed the van.
Okay.
I'll go find someone else! Do you understand that cartoon show? I don't
understand anything anymore.
Hey, Steven.
Is there any more engine oil? I need it for this sandwich.
- Ithink that's for cars.
- Well, is there any more of it? Dad's probably got some outside.
Oh! But, uh, you got to take this online quiz.
- Which Crying Breakfast Friend are you? - That show's really weird.
Who wants to watch a cartoon about people crying? - I do! - Okay, okay! Uh
what's the first question? - Do you ever act without thinking? - Nope.
Never.
Are you afraid of taking risks and trying new things? Terrified.
Amethyst, are you taking this seriously? - Of course I am.
- Okay.
Are you insecure about your relationships and how you're perceived by other
people? N-N-No Yes? Eh - What's the right answer? - There is no right answer.
You're just supposed to answer honestly.
- Nah, I'm bored.
- Wait I have loads more probing, personal questions to ask! Garnet! W-What are
you doing in my room? I saw a corrupted gem.
I followed it through the tunnel it dug in the rock.
- Yeah, right.
- Where did it come from? It's similar to Pearl's description of the creature
she saw slinking through the temple.
- You saw the Slinker?! - I thought we agreed there was no Slinker and that we
weren't going to call it "the Slinker".
Yes, we did.
But now it's undeniable the creature exists - and that Steven's name stuck.
- Yes! No! Look, why don't you just let me look for it? Because you won't.
- How long's this thing been in here? - Ah! Look, Steven! I'm a pachyderm! Oh!
And there's a prize inside! Shhh! Keep quiet.
Oh, Garnet.
Stern but practical.
Just like spilt milk.
You're not still on about that dumb cartoon, are you? Oh, right the quiz! Do
you get defensive when people ask you questions about the feelings you prefer
to keep hidden? Don't get all psycho-logical on me, Steven.
Uh sorry? There! Whoa, mama! Did you get it?! No.
Aw, man! I think my favorite round thing was in there.
I'll get you a new round thing.
Ugh! This is my stuff you're messing with! If it's gonna get Ugh! wrecked, I'm
gonna be the one to wreck it! See?! That's how it's do Amethyst got poofed!
Slinker! G-G-G-Garnet? Steven, remember our bodies are only an illusion.
Amethyst will be fine.
B-B-But Pearl took two whole weeks to come back.
And I already miss Amethyst so much! Don't worry.
She'll be back before you know it.
Literally.
Amethyst's back! Amethyst's back! - Ugh.
Huh? - Looks like you grew a few feet since the last time I saw you! Nyuk,
nyuk, nyuk! That was fast.
Even for you.
Eh! It's no big deal.
I didn't want to keep my biggest fan waiting.
Ugh! Hmm.
Okay, okay! We got a Slinker to slink! Wa-ugh! Hmm.
Where would I go if I was a monster? Hey! Over here.
- Your new form is really interesting.
- Thanks, Steven.
I didn't even know you could come back this different.
- Thanks, Steven.
- So, why'd you come back with four legs? - 'Cause I like walking! - Wow.
I want four legs, too! No, you don't.
Amethyst rushed her regeneration.
- She should have taken her time.
- Like Pearl? Yes.
Pearl put a bit more thought into how she came back.
Pearl, Pearl, Pearl! You know I can hear you! I'm sorry I'm not like Pearl with
her fancy form and her clean room with no monsters in it.
Amethyst? Amethyst's gem! She got poofed again! This is a good opportunity for
her.
Now she can make a better form.
She's coming back! You're right.
This is much better! She's doing Pearl! Hey, Garnet.
What do you think of my new look, Garnet? I'm more like Pearl now.
Isn't it wonderful? Ha! I feel practically perfect! We need to focus on
listening for the creature.
Oh, but I can't focus.
All these rocks are different sizes.
We'll have to organize them by shape and color.
Didn't anyone tell nature how I want it to look? - Don't encourage her.
- But I need encouragement, Garnet.
I need everyone's constant approval.
I need to loquaciously converse so I can show off how smart I am.
You can converse with me.
Let's finish that quiz.
Do you need to plan ahead before you act? - Oh, thoroughly.
- Do you obsess over little details? - Completely entirely! - Wow, you're so
method.
Next time, can you come back as me? This is not a good choice for your form.
Lighten up, Garnet.
Can't you take a joke? It's not funny.
You've made yourself ridiculous.
- Ridiculous?! - Keep your voice down! The creature.
Grrr! You wanted me to be more like Pearl, and now I am! Pearl would have taken
her regeneration seriously! What do you care?! My form is my business! It's my
business when it affects the strength of the team! So what?! I'm not strong
enough? - Amethyst! - Are you saying I'm weak?! Is it weird I'm getting numb to
this? Unh? Mnh! Okay! You know, I wasn't feeling this at first, but I think I
might be coming around! Ha! Yo, Ste-Man.
My seams straight? Does that new form hurt you? No.
Hey, Garnet.
How'd you like to mix it up with this? Just a little somethin' I threw
together.
You know.
This form isn't sustainable, Amethyst.
But you're the one who said I needed to be stronger! Okay, if it's my monster,
then I'll deal with it.
Raaaahh! Amethyst! Stay behind me! Amethyst! Hah! Amethyst! - Let it go! - No!
Ugh.
You wanted me to be stronger! I'm doing it! I'm being what you want! I don't
want this! Huh? Well, what do you want?! Just tell me, and I'll do that! I
can't tell you, Amethyst! You have to figure this out for yourself! She can't.
She doesn't want to think about herself! What? Good catch.
I knew that thing was real! When Amethyst gets back, we have to go find it.
- How long has it been? - Four hours.
Four hours?! She's never taken so long.
What is she doing in there? I'm not sure.
I was too hard on her.
Oh, oh! She's coming back! All right.
Everyone be supportive.
- What? - Aw, you barely changed.
Steven! It's perfect.
Ehh, whatev.
It's just what feels right.
- That's why it's perfect.
- It is a marked improvement.
You finally fixed that shoulder strap that's always bugged me! - Welcome back!
- Well done, Amethyst! Knock it off! Hunnhh! - We got to go find the Slinker! -
No, it's hug time! Ugh! This is so dumb!

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e09 Episode Script ******
**** Sworn to the Sword ****
- We are the Crystal - Gems we'll always save the day and if you think we can't
we'll always find a way - that's why the people - of this world - believe in -
Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl And Steven! "Sworn to the Sword" The sun is
bright, our shirts are clean we're sitting up above the sea come on and share
this jam with me peach or plum or strawberry any kind is fine, you see come on
and share this jam with me I'll do my best to give this jam the sweetness it
deserves and I'll keep it fresh I'm jammin' on these tasty preserves
ingredients in harmony we mix together perfectly come on and share this jam
with me Whoo-hoo! Jam buds! - Nice jam session.
- Don't forget the best part.
Uh Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Run back to your masters! Tell them we're not afraid of
your kind! Thanks for saving my jam snack.
Unfortunately, it's not safe from me.
You're such a good sword fighter, Connie.
Really? I was just swinging this thing around.
I don't really know what I'm doing.
But I'd love to learn how to use a real sword.
Oh! Steven has an idea! - You want me to do what? - You should train Connie to
sword fight.
- She's already so good.
- Steven! But you are.
Y-You helped me fight the robot floaty thing, she took down that evil clone of
herself, uh those mean seagulls just now.
You're awfully young to begin something like this.
But I suppose I was only a few thousand years old when I began fighting
alongside Rose Quartz.
- Yes, Connie? - Please, I want to learn.
I mean, I don't know what will happen in the future.
But if something dangerous comes along, I don't want to be a burden.
I wanna help! I want to be there for Steven, to fight by his side! The Earth is
my home, too.
Can't I help protect it? O-Okay.
If that's how you feel, we should get started.
Woo-hoo! Wait, now? You okay? It can take some getting used to.
Whoo! - Hey, you two.
This way.
- Race you.
Whoa.
This is an ancient sky arena, Connie, where some of the first battles for Earth
took place.
It was here that I became familiar with the human concept of being a knight,
completely dedicated to a person and a cause.
This is what you must become, Connie brave, selfless, loyal a knight.
We begin with a bow.
First to me, your teacher.
And now again to your liege.
- Okay.
My liege.
- Miss Knight.
I hope you two are taking this seriously.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Cool.
Hologram Pearl.
To begin, this holo-Pearl will be your opponent.
Level 0, beginner set.
Do you wish to engage in combat? Yes! - Steven? - Hmm? Oh! Um, I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Reflex.
Uh, you just be careful, and I will go over here.
All right.
Everything begins with your stance.
Remember You do it for him and you would do it again you do it for her that is
to say you'll do it for him keep your stance wide keep your body lowered as
you're moving forward balance is the key right foot, left foot now go even
faster and as you're moving backwards keep your eyes on me - keep my stance
wide - Good.
- keep my body lowered - Right.
- as I'm moving forward - Concentrate.
Don't you want him to live? right foot, left foot Yes, but put your whole body
into it.
everything you have, everything you are you've got to give on the battlefield
when everything is chaos and you have nothing but the way you feel your
strategy and a sword you just think about the life you'll have together after
the war and then you do it for her that's how you know you can win you do it
for her that is to say you'll do it for him deep down you know you weren't
built for fighting but that doesn't mean you're not prepared to try what they
don't know is your real advantage when you live for someone you're prepared to
die deep down, I know that I'm just a human - True.
- but I know that I can but you know that you can - draw my sword and fight -
draw your sword and fight - with my short existence - Good.
- I can make a difference - Yes, excellent.
I can be there for him I can be his knight I can do it for him you do it for
her - okay, now, do that again - Yes, ma'am.
you do it for her, and now you say I'll do it for him - Connie! - Hey, Steven.
- Connie, wait.
- Hmm? Ah, right on time.
- Can we talk for a moment? - Sure.
What's up? We have important training to do, Connie.
- Yes, ma'am.
- She's been making great strides, Steven.
- She's going to be an asset to you.
- Hmph.
Wow, Garnet.
That was the funniest thing I've ever heard.
- Garnet, master of comedy.
- Yo, Steven.
Why are you standing there all sad like that?! W-Well, Connie is taking sword-
fighting lessons from Pearl.
But I think it's getting a little too serious.
She wants Connie to do all this dangerous stuff for me.
- That makes sense.
- What do you mean? Back during the war, Pearl took pride in risking her
destruction for your mother.
She put Rose Quartz over everything over logic, over consequence, over her own
life.
Hyah! - You okay, dude? - I have to do something! Thanks for telling me that!
Bye! Remember, Connie.
In the heat of battle, Steven is what matters.
You don't matter.
- I don't matter.
- Huh? Now, let us begin! Connie? Connie, where are you? Connie! You wouldn't
have happened to see Connie, would you? Unregistered combatant detected.
Connie! Steven? What are you doing out here? Connie, I don't want you to do
this anymore not alone.
No, Steven.
I understand now.
Your legacy, your destiny you are everything! And I I am nothing.
But I can do this for you.
I can give you my service.
- No! I don't want you to.
- Steven, I'm doing this for you! Hyah! I need to be able to protect you.
But if you're the one protecting me, then who's the one protecting you? Someday
soon, we may be fighting some really bad guys.
And when that day comes, I want to fight with you, together.
So, please, won't you share this jam with me? - This is much easier.
- That's the idea.
No matter what comes, we do this together! Steven! Steven, don't interfere.
She needs to take me on herself.
Why? We're a team.
- She's the strawberry - And he's the biscuit! - And that makes us jam - Buds!
Wha? Hyah! Enough! No! In a real battle, Steven won't be there to save you! -
Yes, I will! - Steven, you don't know that! Yes, I do! If Connie is going to
fight, - we're going to fight together! - That's right! You shouldn't be
anywhere near the fight! You're too important! - I am not! - Yes, you are! -
No! - Why won't you just let me do this for you, Rose!? I I mean let her do
this.
Why won't you let Connie do this for you? That's enough for today.
Hey, Pearl I didn't mean to mess up your training.
But all that "you're nothing" talk was really freaking me out.
Did Rose make you feel like you were nothing? Heh Rose made me feel like I was
everything.
I see now how deeply you care about each other.
That will make you both great knights! Connie is practically an expert.
So, Steven, you have a lot of catching up to do.
Oh, I'm so excited.
I can't wait for the midair and underwater dueling exercises.
It's going to be boodles of fun!

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e10 Episode Script ******
**** Rising Tides, Crashing Skies ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Rising Tides, Crashing Skies" Beach City a sleepy seaside town.
From far away, it looks ordinary, but take a closer look, and you'll start to
notice the cracks in the facade.
My name is uh My name is Ronaldo.
For years, I've run a blog called "Keep Beach City weird.
" My mission keep Beach City weird! And also to expose the truth.
Most people choose to ignore my mind-blowing revelations.
But no one could deny it when the truth was pointing right in the town's
collective face.
It's an invasion! Look at that thing! It's right there! Beach City needed to be
saved.
But from what? Duhm! Duhm! Duhm! Eh, I was just cleaning up some fish for a
very big order when it happened.
I felt this very peculiar rumbling, like, "boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!"
And then a sonic boom! And the fish I was preparing flew up into the air and
fell on the ground.
I ran outside and saw this great big thing in the sky.
- The town was under attack! - What is this for, again? It's a web-sclusive for
my bl Oh.
Uh, yes.
That day was crazy.
- The mayor said - Were you scared?! What?! No! I wasn't I was just concerned
that something bad - would happen to the shop.
- So you cried a lot? I don't know what you're talking about.
Let it go! Dad, no! Please, no! I was under a lot of stress at the time! - Aww.
Hey.
- What? I'm here for you, bro.
- Mmmm.
- I'm fine! Let me go! You can't make up drama this good! With the space hand
closing in for a high-five of the third kind, we fled the town.
But then, just as mysteriously as the space hand appeared, it exploded into an
explosion.
What in blue blazes was that?! I think it was an explosion.
Unbelievable.
I missed it! There's no actual footage of the giant hand thing crashing into
the beach, but here's a little re-enactment for you.
Whoooooooa! Pfff! Whah! Ouch.
Ouch, ouch, ouch.
My hand! Beach City was saved.
But by whom? - Miss! - Huh? Who do you think saved Beach City from the giant
hand craft? Oh.
Hey, Ronaldo.
Wait.
A-Are you filming? Please answer the question.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, yeah, sure.
Who saved us? Um, well, wasn't it Steven's family? I-I think they pretty much
keep to themselves.
Steven says they protect the planet and the human race and that they have magic
powers.
It sounds hard to believe, but I've seen some pretty wild stuff.
Once, they made us hamburgers, and we were having a pretty good time.
But then we were attacked by a huge creature.
- Hey! You making a movie? - Oh, let him be.
It's a docu-web-umentary about the Crystal Gems.
They are c-ra-zy.
One of them tried to knock me in the face.
I ain't mad, though.
Mayor Dewey, who do you think saved Beach City from the hand craft? Why, young
man, I credit the voters with saving Beach City.
My constituents know they've elected a mayor whom they can trust to Huh? No,
I'm talking about the Crystal Gems.
W-Why? Well, I'm covering the story.
Cover-up?! What cover-up?! - But, mayor - Security! H-Hey! You can't suppress
the truth! Obviously, the Crystal Gems were involved, even at the highest
levels of local government.
I decided to go to the source.
Speak up! Right now, I'm standing directly below the fortress of the Crystal
Gems! I am now going to attempt to make contact with the mysterious, reclusive,
and Hi, Ronaldo.
Uh, hi, Peedee.
Is that a camera? Yeah.
We're making a movie about It's an investigative report, shot camera
vÃÂ£ÃÂ©ritÃÂ£ÃÂ©.
Cool! So want to participate in a groundbreaking interview? Hmm.
Only if you participate in a glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade! Ohhh.
That giant hand? - It was a spaceship coming to get us.
- Us?! I knew it! - Steven, we know too much! - No, not "us" us.
I-I meant me and the Crystal Gems.
Wait.
So the hand wasn't here to snatch up humans for a human zoo? Or interfere with
our subsidized Beach City wind farm? Or thaw the cryogenically frozen pets of
the one percent?! Uh no, I'm pretty sure it came to Beach City for - me and the
Crystal Gems.
- Oh.
So if you and the Crystal Gems weren't here, we wouldn't have been attacked by
the giant hand? Ohh.
Definitely not.
And there it was.
The Crystal Gems weren't saving us.
They were putting us in danger.
I felt I had no choice but to lay bare this ugly truth to the unwitting
citizens of Beach City.
Ma'am! Are you aware that the Crystal Gems not only saved the town but also
caused the invasion in the first place? Oh.
Well, no more fish are getting knocked out of my hands, so I'm not complaining.
Sir! Sir! How do you feel about the Crystal Gems attracting an onslaught of
dangerous space beings? Do you feel safe? Hey! You can't keep quiet forever!
How can you possibly go on, knowing that we are under siege by forces meant to
destroy the Crystal Gems? How close are you to being done with this project?
Just answer the question, dad! I-I guess it's pretty bad.
But what's a regular guy like me supposed to do about it? I've got work to do.
And so do you! Put down that camera! Everyone was too afraid to realize they
were actually afraid.
Beach City needed a hero.
And that hero would have to be me.
- Whoa, whoa - Okay, everything's ready for our full-on nighttime stealth
coverage.
Is it really okay for us to be lurking around here like this? We're not
lurking! We're investigating! This is a moment of true bravery.
Are you brave like me? I'm so brave to be doing this.
Come on! Stay back, little bro! Race you back to the danger zone.
- Wait up! - Steven! Uh, hey, Ronaldo.
Hey, Peedee.
- You guys should be careful - Cut the pleasantries! - You're all a danger to
our city! - What are you talking about? Pearl! Now! Hohhh, my gosh! What the
heck is that?! Pearl! Now! - Ha! - Aim for the eye! Aye-aye, Garnet.
- Where's Amethyst? - Right here! Let's finish the job.
This is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about, Steven! But the Crystal
Gems are here to help people.
But all the monsters just come here to get you guys and then wreck things and
put us in danger! Beach City would be way safer if you guys weren't here!
Listen, Frybo.
Magic beings are indeed drawn to us, but we were here long before Beach City
even existed.
Who cares how long you've been here?! Innocent people are in danger as long as
you're hanging around! You're right.
I guess we'll just leave, then.
- Excuse me? - Really?! - But, Garnet - Put your buts away, Steven.
We're not wanted here, so let's just leave.
But, Garnet, we'll have to move all the bubbles.
A-And what about Steven's things? Man! Ugh.
I kind of liked it here.
Uh mission accomplished! Uh, you can turn the camera o That's right.
I did it.
Thanks to me, the Gems are gone forever.
Mm.
That's too bad.
Now you won't have anything to blog about anymore.
Come on, dude.
I'm trying to finish the movie.
Well, this relates to your movie.
You said it yourself the gems cause all the weird stuff in Beach City, so now
that they're gone, there'll be no more weird stuff.
No No! What have I done?! What had I done? I done bad.
I made a terrible mistake.
This this is This is a matter of weird and death! I'm going as fast as I can!
Crystal Gems! You have to stay! Every messed-up consequence of your presence
gives me reason to wake up in the morning! Without you, my blog doesn't stand a
chance! I'm too late! What have I done?! I've made Beach City normal! I've
broken my promise to the city! And to myself! You're still here! Please don't
leave! I was wrong! Stay and keep this town weird! I had no idea how this
Crystal Gem would respond to my plea.
The answer will shock you.
Okay.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I had skillfully negotiated for the Gems to
stay.
Perhaps I have a future in intergalactic diplomacy? In the end, I suppose the
gems really do save Beach City from being not weird! Okay, Peedee, I think that
about wraps it up.
- Good job with the camera, bro.
- Oh.
Thanks.
That was very poorly edited.
Were we really gonna leave Beach City? No.
I just wanted him to get that camera out of my face.
I wonder how many people have seen this thing.
Oh.
I think we're the only ones.
See? Hmm.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e11 Episode Script ******
**** Keeping It Together ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Keeping It Together" We need to track down Peridot.
We found her pod.
We know she's out there somewhere.
She came to Earth with a job to do, and odds are she's still gonna try to do
it.
That's why I've gathered you here.
I thought it was so you could help me fold all this laundry.
Mm, that too.
The chore wheel idea you had fell apart fast.
Wasn't me.
I just really enjoy doing all of those things.
It's better if we do them together.
Humans should just stop wearing clothes.
- It'd be a lot funnier.
- Hey! I'm a civilified part-human, thank you very much.
- Clothing is a must.
- Hmm.
This is a lot.
I bet this folding would go faster if Ruby and Sapphire were here.
I'm sure they'd be glad to see you, Steven, but I am not unfusing for laundry.
- Aw.
- Garnet, you don't think Peridot would come looking for us, do you? We weren't
her priority.
She was sent here to do something in the Kindergarten.
Do you think she's still going to try to reactivate it? Mm.
If she gets it up and running, - the injectors will turn back on.
- In jectors? - W-What are those? - You've already seen them.
Well, you've seen them disabled.
If Peridot reactivates them, they'll pick right up where they left off planting
Gems in the crust of the Earth, where they'll incubate and suck the life right
out of the ground.
We can't let Peridot restart Gem production here.
- If we do, the entire planet will become - Janked.
Garnet! That mouth! Don't worry.
We'll stop her.
- Come on, Crystal Gems.
- Coming.
As long as we don't have to fold anything.
- Steven.
- Come on.
That means you, too, right? You're a civilified part-Gem, too, after all.
Garnet, are you sure we should bring Steven? - This might be dangerous.
- Peridot's got nothing we can't handle.
Well, nothing looks activated.
In fact, it doesn't look like anything's budged - since the last time we were
here.
- You're right.
But just because Peridot hasn't been here yet - doesn't mean she won't come.
- Hm.
Let's do a thorough check of the perimeter.
- Mm-hmm.
- That way, we can monitor - any future entry.
- Hm.
Sounds good to me.
Mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm Log date 652.
This is Peridot.
Updating status still stuck on miserable planet.
The fusion experiments are developing properly.
A few have even emerged early Eugggh! Huh! Are the other ones with you? - Of
course.
Why not? - Peridot! There she is! There's nowhere to go! You're cornered! Hey!
I can't do that! Neither can she! Ha! Missed! Huh? Do you think she's hurt?!
Nope.
Whoooa! Hot whip! You crystal clods! Go ahead! Wreck this place! See if I care.
I already got what I needed.
Get back here! - I'm gonna bop her good! - I'll help! Hurry, Garnet! If
Peridot's mission was to reactivate the Kindergarten, the injectors would be
on.
Look.
- They're not.
- Oh.
Oh.
Let's see what she was actually doing.
- Down here.
- Oh.
Oh! You're brains and brawn the whole package.
- Thank you.
- Ah.
Is it 'cause you're a fusion? I have to keep some of my secrets.
Aw, please? I want to know! Is the strong part of you Ruby and the wise part of
you Sapphire? It's all of both.
When two Gems combine, it creates something greater than the sum of their
parts.
That's why I'm so great.
What's it like to stay fused all the Whoa.
I don't know how, but this place is even creepier than the last time we were
here.
Yes.
There's something going on.
The power's not on.
What was Peridot doing? It looks like she pulled these out of the walls.
Something's strange.
Garnet? Is there something in there? Whoa! What are they? What is it? It looks
like two gem shards stuck together.
Is that what all these things are? Gems stuck together? Garnet? What was that?
- Mnh-mnh.
- Garnet? Uh Garnet! What do we do?! Please! Talk to me! These were Crystal
Gems shattered into pieces.
- They were buried together.
- Why aren't you moving?! They were forced together.
They were forced to fuse.
This is wrong.
I-I-I'm sorry.
No! No, Garnet! You're coming undone! Garnet! Garnet! Garnet! Please! What's
the matter?! This isn't like you! We did it! Garnet? So, this is what homeworld
thinks of fusion.
We couldn't have known they would do this.
This is where they've been all the ones we couldn't find.
They've been here the whole time! Rose couldn't have known.
This was punishment for the rebellion! - It's not our fault! - Garnet! S-
Steven.
Yo.
We're back.
Garnet, we lost Peridot.
Her fingers were too fast for us.
- Um what are these things? - Put them down! What? We need to poof and bubble
all of them.
We can't let any escape.
Oh.
Hey, Garnet.
How's it going? Still damp.
Oh.
Right the clothes.
There are towels in there.
Do we even have plumbing up here? How do you get the washer and dryer to work?
Magic.
- Are you all right? - I wish you hadn't seen that.
- Aw, it's okay.
- It's not okay.
- W-Why? - What homeworld did taking the shattered parts of fallen Gems and
combining them.
Those Gems weren't asked permission.
Fusion is a choice.
Those Gems weren't given a choice.
It isn't right! It isn't fusion! What's it like, being a fusion? - You've
fused.
- I mean, like, all the time.
Do you forget who you used to be? You forget you were ever alone.
You know, when you fuse, you don't feel like two people.
You feel like one being.
And your old names might as well be names for your left arm and your right.
When you split up, is it like you disappear? I embody my I mean, Ruby and
Sapphire's love.
I'll always exist in them, even if I split apart.
But the strength of that love keeps me together, so I can stay Garnet for a
very long time.
That's why you're so great.
Oh, no! - Don't want to break up a pair.
- Yeah.
You're right.
They belong together.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e12 Episode Script ******
**** We Need to Talk ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "We Need to Talk" Here's all the Orange Magic Orchestra ones.
Great, put them in the transcendental space rock pile.
At home, we only have classical music And movie soundtracks.
I've never heard any of these.
You've never heard the Philosophy Majors? Oh, man.
Give it here.
This will really knock your socks off.
- Come on.
- Whoa! - You two can fuse?! - Uh yes? Uh, uh, uh, that's in incredible! Since
when? Wait, how is this even possible? The Gems think it's 'cause I'm half-
human.
Please don't tell my parents, Mr.
Universe.
They don't know I've been doing magic stuff with Steven.
I can't tell them.
They're not going to understand I Whoa, whoa, it it's okay.
I may be the only human being on the planet - who's gonna understand.
- W-What do you mean? - Yeah, what do you mean? - Well Story! Come on.
We're ready.
I didn't think I'd be telling you this so soon.
Probably best to start with this.
Everybody ready? What can I do for you? What can I do that No one else can do?
What can I do for you? What can I do for you? Human man You are so much fun I
hadn't planned on finding you quite this entertaining - # I like your band # -
Whoo! And I like your song I like the way human beings play I like playing
along Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa-ho What can I do for you? What can I do that No one
else can do? What can I do for you? What can I do for you? Tsk.
I can't believe I got that on video! - What on Earth was that?! - That was
Rainbow Quartz.
Pearl thought a fusion might give your video a little something extra.
Pretty cool, right? I have to go, but are you doing anything later? You know
I'm not.
You're adorable, Mr.
Universe.
- See you later.
- Bye Hey, I hit the drums, so pay up.
Here you go.
You're just a phase.
You know that, right? No.
I actually don't know that, Pearl.
Well, of course you don't.
You don't know anything about Rose.
- I know she's super into me.
- Listen Mr.
Universe.
Rose may find you charming, but that's only because you're human.
- You're a novelty at best.
- What makes you so sure? Oh it's very simple.
Humans can't fuse.
Fusion is the ultimate connection between Gems.
And you are not a Gem.
Well, has any human ever tried fusing with a Gem? - Uh, no, I-I don't think so.
- Well, then, I will try! Aw, geez, what am I doing? These things are
expensive.
Oh, geez! How did she get her legs to do that? Hey.
Are you dead? What? Oh, no no.
I'm alive.
Whoa, cool! It's us from before.
Yeah, I was just trying to get my head around - this fusion dance.
- A fusion dance ain't about your head! Wait, you guys are Gems.
You've got to help me out here.
I need to be able to fuse with Rose.
First, you need the gem at the core of your being.
Then you need the body that could turn into light.
Then you need the partner who you trust with that light.
- Metaphorically? - Literally.
Shh.
Come on.
I still want to see him try.
Ugh, so it's true.
I really can't do it.
I'm kidding myself with this.
I'm never gonna be a Gem.
Amethyst, give us some privacy! Yeah! Let me tell you something, Mr.
Universe.
I think you can do it.
But it won't work if you dance like Pearl.
You have to dance like you.
You have to fuse your way.
Get open.
Get honest.
Invent yourselves together.
That's fusion.
I think I get it.
What's all this? - We We didn't fuse.
- What?! You can't fuse.
- You're a human - I know! That's the problem! I'm just a human.
That's not a problem.
I love humans.
- You're all so funny.
- Ugh.
Look, these last few months have been great.
- Oh, yes.
- But I'm getting a little - worried about the future.
- Oh, just ask Garnet.
I'm starting to wonder if you respect me? - Oh, you're hilarious, Mr.
Universe.
- Rose, please! Can you just talk to me for one second like a real person?! I'm
not a real person.
I thought Haven't we - Is this not how it works? - Oh.
Oh, boy.
This is so weird.
You really are an alien.
Why are you laughing? Why are you crying? - How are we gonna make this work? -
Fusion? No, "us.
" We're really, really different.
What do we do now? Let's just talk.
- I barely know you.
- That's a good thing.
We really rushed into this.
Everything on Earth seems fast to me.
- Do you miss your home planet? - No.
Never.
How did you end up with, uh, harpo, groucho, and chico? Huh? Oh, them.
Those are three long stories.
- What are they doing? - Shh! Have you loved other humans? Have you? - Yes.
- Yes.
Have you ever been in love with a human? - How would I know? - It's torture.
- Greg.
- Rose.
- Is this torture? - The worst.
- I'm so sorry.
- Huh? No! Don't be.
What?! Why not?! - Oh, I'm so confused! - Me, too.
Well, uh, this is good.
We've got one thing in common.
Ha! Ohh! Why are they still dancing? I-I-It didn't work.
- Yes, it did.
- What?! - It worked.
- I think this one's my favorite.
I think he's her favorite, too.
- Whoa.
- So, you guys were never able to fuse? Uh, no.
But that wasn't as important as talking to each other.
Look, humans and Gems it's still some pretty new territory.
You're gonna have to work it out together.
And, Connie, if you ever need to talk to another human being about this, you
can always talk to me.
- Mm.
- Human beings? - Human beings.
- Human beings

if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Chille Tid" Ugh! This isn't getting us anywhere! What's the
matter, perogie? You tired? I don't get tired.
I get results.
Was the sign for "pull me up" one wiggle or two? Amethyst, stay focused.
For all we know, Lapis and Jasper's fusion could be right under our noses.
This is why we wear life jackets.
- Are Are you all right? - Huh.
Nothing.
Oh, it feels like we've been searching for light years.
Uh, light years measures light.
Not years.
And I'm sick of these life diapers.
- Safety is no punch line, Pearl.
- Safety is our job.
We must find Jasper and Lapis.
As it stands, - their fusion is a ticking time bomb.
- Is Lapis gonna be okay? She had control when she used her power to drag their
fusion into the ocean, but a fusion like theirs is unstable, bound together by
anger and mistrust.
If that bond snaps, their anger will take over and destroy.
Don't worry, Lapis.
We won't let you sleep with the fishes.
We're gonna have to keep looking.
- But first, let's bring Steven home.
- Huh? What? Wha? No.
I'm I'm I'm fine.
Let's Let's go fishing.
- First one to catch something wins.
- I win.
We should be out there searching, not in here not searching.
"Sleep is a curse, and yet a curse I need to live.
" Steven Universe.
Steven isn't like us.
He needs rest.
Don't you guys need rest, too? You look exhausted.
We look awesome.
Look, you can't really knock sleep until you try it.
And maybe we can throw a little fun into the mix - with a slumber party! - F-
Fun? Yeah.
All of us together, peacefully dozing off.
It'll be like there isn't a vengeful fusion boiling the ocean with hatred.
Steven's right.
You should stay here and relax, but I'm going.
'Cause I'm always relaxed.
But Garnet, you couldn't possibly search the ocean by yourself.
Let me let us help you.
- We're a team! - No.
Right now, you're a party a slumber party.
Steven, put these Gems to bed.
Don't stay up too late.
There's snacks in the fridge.
Bye.
Now, before we get this slumber party started, would either of you care for a
slumber companion? I'm good.
- Pearl? - I'll pass on the slumber pals.
- Okay.
Sleep it up, then.
- Oh, right.
- Is this right? - No, you should lay down.
I get it now.
- Am I doing it? - Well, that's way better than before.
But close your eyes all the way.
Okay.
All right.
I'm sleeping now.
- I'm sleeping.
- You can't talk while you sleep.
- How's this even supposed to work?! - It's easy.
You just lie down, get nice and comfy, don't move, and don't think about
anything.
Steven Universe was filmed before a live studio audience.
Oh, my goodness, Connie's going to be here any second now.
I can't believe it.
Your first school dance.
Let me just fix your tie and Stop fussing over Steven like a baby.
Amethyst, what did I tell you about riding that thing in the house? Have fun at
your dance, dude.
- Oh! - Bungacowa! Amethyst, I'm gonna get you! Just a second, Connie.
You won't believe what Amethyst just huh? - Can I help you? - Chille tid.
- Oh, hi, Garnet.
- Hey, Steven.
You got to come to the beach tonight.
There's gonna be this huge bonfire party thing.
I can't go to that.
I'm going to the big dance with Connie.
Wow.
"The big dance.
" Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Well She's here! Okay, I'm ready for the big dance Con Huh? Lapis? Are you
okay? Ah! Ugh! Oh, man I feel asleep and had this weird dream.
I opened the door and Lapis was there, and Well, that doesn't make any sense.
Lapis is fused with Jasper at the bottom of the ocean.
- You've never had a dream before, huh? - Uh I don't think so.
Well, Pearl, dreams don't always make sense.
When you dream, the thoughts in your head get all mixed up into a weird movie.
And they're really hard to explain, which is why they're boring to listen to.
Like this one time, I had a dream where, like, these things were being sold at
the Big Donut, right? But the front door of the Big Donut shop led to the back
of my dad's van.
So, I go into the van, and lion is driving for some reason, but he's driving
really well.
And and then I say to him, I says, "lion " "lion, how did you learn to drive
you a v-van? You can't even you you can't bring me my Whoo! Dogcopter! Mr.
Copter, sir, I'm one of your biggest fans! Can I please have your autograph?
Mr.
Copter, please Hey, wait! Where are you going? I hope the rumors about
Dogcopter in the tabloids aren't true.
Huh? Oh, hey, Pearl! Wait don't eat me! Ptoo! Ooh! Oh, man.
Thanks for the upgrade, Pearl! Now I can catch up with Dog Whoa.
Amethyst? Hmm.
This is getting really weird.
- This is weird.
- Hey, that sounds a lot like - Steven! - Lapis Lazuli! Steven, wh-what are you
doing in here? Uh, I know it's weird, but I'm just dreaming, - so don't even
worry about it.
- What? No! Steven, I'm trying to concentrate.
How are you here? - Oh, my gosh.
Are you okay? - Steven, please, I Ugh Lapis! Amethyst? Hey, what are you
laughing at? Oh, Rose! This is wonderful! I'm just having so much fun spending
time with you, Rose! Forget about Greg.
Let's go travel the galaxy! Pearl, thank you so much for fixing my van! - Oh!
Ugh! - Blegh Gah! - Pearl? - Uh yes, Steven? I had another dream about Lapis.
Oh that's okay! Dreams aren't real! They're just mixed-up movies! - But I I
think I was talking to her.
- Wait.
How do you know? I don't, but I could just feel it.
She was yelling, and she was really freaked out.
What did she say? Is she still in control? I I don't know.
Steven, you could be using your dreams to connect with her mentally.
Can you do it again? Maybe Lapis can just tell you where they are.
I guess I have to go back to sleep.
Quick, Pearl, tell me about your dream so I can fall asleep.
M-My dream? Come on, Pearl! It's for the greater good! - Ha, ha! - If I must.
So, in my dream, I was - What? - Wow! He been sleep.
Oh! I know this is a dream now, so I can imagine anything I want.
Uh mashed potato.
Hmm.
Now how do I find Lapis? Not Lapis.
Not Lapis.
Not Lapis.
Ugh! Lion? Wait.
You're not lion.
Whoa! Ow.
What is this place? - Lapis! - Steven! Why do you keep coming back? I can't get
distracted! I-I've got to hold us down with the weight of your planet's ocean.
I've got to keep her Wait, Lapis, tell me where you are.
We can help you.
I told you! No! - You! - Jasper! You! You! You! Gaah! Ohh! No! - Lapis! - Can't
you see? I can't stop, not for a second.
Don't look for me.
- I don't want your help.
- B-But Just let me do this for you! - Lapis - No! I'm not Lapis anymore.
We're Malachite now.
Lapis, no! Oooragh! Go! Lapis! Steven, it's okay.
We're here.
- Did you see her? - Yeah.
She's still fused.
And she's still in control, but I don't know for how long.
And - This is a weird party.
- Garnet! Mm.
- Steven, you're still awake.
- Amethyst was on a skateboard.
And then Dogcopter meowed at me and was just not interested in what I had to
say at all! And I might have some issues I need to work out but Lapis, she's
out there, and she's still Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I know you're worried, but there's nothing we can do right now.
So let's take it easy.
I'll show you how it's done.
- That's pretty convincing.
- Garnet?

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e14 Episode Script ******
**** Cry for Help ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Cry For Help" I don't get this cartoon, man.
Why don't they just eat the ice cream off the floor? They don't have to cry
about it.
Aw, not again.
It was doing this yesterday, too.
Hang on.
I got it.
- How about now? - It's never done that before.
On all frequencies Peridot.
This is Peridot, transmitting on all frequencies from abandoned crystal system
colony planet Earth to yellow diamond.
My mission has been compromised.
My escort and informant are gone, and I am now stranded' Please send help! This
is Peridot, transmitting on all frequencies Okay.
Thanks.
Connie says it's on her TV, too.
But where could Peridot be broadcasting a signal that strong? There's only one
place.
- Lion, are you okay? - It's as I feared.
It looks like Peridot somehow repaired the communication hub.
Well, at least some of it.
So we just got to wreck it up again, right? - You guys should form Sugilite! -
Yeah? Well, uh, it's up to Garnet, I guess.
What do you say? - Shall we mash it up? - No.
But don't we need to be huge like last time? Last time was a disaster.
Last time we fused, Sugilite went berserk.
And it's because of her that we can't even warp here anymore.
I could be rash, you could be reckless, and we could both get carried away.
So, for the time being, Sugilite is benched.
What we need now is to be careful.
It's you and me, Pearl.
Let's fuse.
Don't cry, Pearl.
- Come on.
Let's do this.
- I'm right behind you.
Whoo-hoo! Fusion! Fusion! Fusion! Fusion! Ready.
Hang on.
It's been such a long time.
Good evening, everybody! This is the lovely Sardonyx, coming to you live from
the soon-to-be former communication hub.
How are y'all doing tonight? - Great - Giant woman! Oh, my stars.
If it isn't Steven Universe.
We finally meet.
So what do you think? Was I worth the wait? What am I saying? Of course I was.
Wow.
You're so articulated.
Well, aren't you the sweetest little charmer? I could literally squish you
right now.
It would not be hard.
Ohh! Sorry.
I'm just so excited to be here.
You see, I haven't exactly been myself lately.
Fusion joke.
And jokes aren't the only thing I've got.
Hmm? Oh! Are you gonna smash stuff with your war hammer? Hmm.
"Smash" is the word one would use to describe what someone else might do.
Now the proper words used to describe yours truly are "specific" "intelligent"
"accurate" "faultless" "elegant" "controlled" "surgical," "graceful" and
"powerful"! But, yes, occasionally, I am known to smash.
Now, just remember, everybody if you ever have need of the lovely Sardonyx, let
Pearl and Garnet know.
I'll be there in a flash literally.
- Oh! - Whoo! Whoo! You guys were amazing! We were? Oh.
Well, that's good.
We were awesome! Why don't we do that more often? Why, pear? Why did you lie to
me? I didn't mean to.
Aw.
Pear.
- I'd forgive her.
Wouldn't you? - Mm.
Oh, hey, Amethyst.
You're missing "Crying breakfast friends.
" That's okay.
I'm fine.
- But it's a really good one so far.
- Not really.
Don't worry.
I'm recording it for later.
- It's the signal again! - Peridot! - Pearl, the signal is back.
- Again? - We need to get back out there.
- Right.
Steven, where's lion? Amethyst, get your head out of the fridge.
Let's go, guys.
- I hope you're ready.
- You know I am.
What's this an encore performance? Just couldn't get enough of me, could you?
What are we waiting for? Let the show begin! Maybe you're better off with her I
think she's better for you I forgot how great it felt to be us guess I got
carried away I had to use you to make me feel strong but I don't care about
that now I see a tower built out of my mistakes and it all comes crashing down
is there something I can do? is there something I can do? is there something I
can do? can I make it up to you? Hmm.
Peridot's been back here twice, so the odds are good she'll come back again,
right? Bam! That's when we'll get her.
- Yeah.
Bam! - Garnet will be so impressed.
And then she'll think I'm cool again! Mm-hmm.
Nothing more nothing There she is! No, wait.
That's just a weird cactus.
I don't think she's coming.
Uh, what are you doing? If you make your eyes blurry, it looks like there's a
little magic sausage between your fingers.
This is stupid.
- It doesn't even work.
- Try this.
Hey, don't mess with my oh! Well, even if we didn't catch Peridot, at least I
taught you a great way to pass the time.
- What? - I think I saw something.
It's Peridot's escape pod.
She fixed it somehow? - But I thought we had it.
- Did she steal it from the temple? Whoa.
She's lifting the pillar guys.
And she's fixing the hub.
What's she doing up there? Enhance.
Hey, for some reason, Peridot kind of looks like Pearl? What?! Let me see.
Oh, no.
Why would Pearl rebuild the hub? Maybe she's trying to study how it works? No.
I don't think that's it.
Maybe she's trying to get us more channels? Oh! This is no good.
- W-What's wrong? - It's Peridot.
She must have fixed the communication hub again.
Garnet it's the hub again.
She's evading my future vision.
No matter how many times I try, I can't see us finding Peridot.
Come on, team.
I can't believe Peridot is giving us so much trouble.
But it hardly matters, right, Garnet? We can disable this tower as many times
as we need to together, okay? Okay.
I'm ready.
Are you ready, Garnet? - I know what she's doing.
- You do? - Stop! - Hmm? Is something the matter, Amethyst? You You shouldn't.
- Pearl, we saw you.
- What? - You need to tell Garnet it was you.
- I don't understand.
I'm sorry.
It's just so much fun being Sardonyx with you.
Uh! That's why I couldn't see us finding Peridot.
- Wait.
Let me explain! - You've been fixing the hub! It really was Peridot the first
time.
- You tricked me.
- No.
No, no, no, no.
No, we just needed a reason to fuse.
I just wanted to share a few more victories with you.
- Those weren't victories.
- Wait, Garnet.
You know, we're so much weaker than you.
Fusing with you is like our one chance to feel stronger.
Don't defend her.
Peridot is out there somewhere, and Pearl's been distracting us with nothing! -
Garnet - That's enough! Amethyst, fuse with me.
- But - Let's just get this over with.
Please forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.
Man.
It sure would be nice if things worked out the way they do in cartoons.
Yeah.
It would.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e15 Episode Script ******
**** Keystone Motel ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Keystone Motel" Pearl! Where've you been? Eh.
Looking for Peridot.
For a few days straight.
Steven, I know I might have disappointed all of you.
I know Garnet's very upset with me.
But I'm going to prove to her that she can trust me again.
Oh, Garnet! I was just looking for Peridot! She's bound to be somewhere, right?
Any new ideas? I'm sorry.
Who wants to go on a road trip?! - Um is this a bad time? - No.
Please continue.
Well, I gotta drive over to the next state, Keystone.
- You mean, the Keystone state? - Right, the state named Keystone.
I met a guy on an internet message board who's selling car-wash brushes for
real cheap! I just gotta meet him in Keystone and pick 'em up.
I don't like those brushes.
They feel weird on your fur.
- Well, do you like motels? - Probably! Think you'd like to stay at a motel
with your favorite dad? - I don't know if you're my favorite - What? Huh? - Oh,
you kidder.
Come here.
- I can't wait to get room service! You're thinking of a hotel.
We're going to a motel! It'll have a pool and free ice.
And it's right next to the best diner in the world! - I'm coming, too.
- What? Even better! Hey, Garnet, I know I'm talking this place up, - but it
ain't exactly the Ritz.
- I'll be the judge of that.
Well, in that case road trip! - Road trip! - Road trip.
Wonderful! I'll make sure Amethyst knows that Fine.
Well, goodbye.
This is gonna be fun, right, Dad? Another great thing about motels you can
drive right up to your door! I'm gonna swim in the pool, order a movie, get
free ice! It's gonna be great! Not before we check for bedbugs, it isn't! - Mm.
- Good news! We're bugless! Oop, that's my cue.
Hey, do you mind holding down the fort till I get back? Great.
I'm off to see a man about a tunnel brush.
An internet man.
If I'm not back in an hour, call the police.
Oh-kay! Bounce with me, Garnet! O-Or we could look at brochures.
- Ooh, Keystone caverns.
- Calm down.
I don't feel like forgiving Pearl! Don't understand we must! If you're not
going to listen, then you can just go! We must move past this, Ruby.
She lied to us so we'd form Sardonyx! She tricked us! Don't you feel used?!
Ruby! Sapphire! I - You're choosing to take it personally.
- It's fusion, Sapphire! What's more personal to us than fusion?! I know you're
still upset.
- Oh, so it's just me? - Of course not.
Can't you see I'm completely engulfed with rage? Well, it doesn't feel like it!
The sooner we forgive Pearl, the better it will be for us all.
You're not as above this as you think you are! Yes, I am.
You can't stay angry with her forever.
- Wanna bet? - Ruby, the carpet.
You I can't even ugh! Nice to see you again? Nice to see you, too.
Hey, Ruby.
You wanna swim in the pool? It's fusion, Steven! It's like Sapphire doesn't
even care! And we're supposed to be the bigger Gem about this.
We're always the bigger Gem! Well, not this time! Not about this! Come on, why
don't you come cool down in the pool? I don't need to cool down! Come on, Ruby.
The water's nice! Why does she always act like I'm being ridiculous? Just
because she wants to pretend that she doesn't have feelings?! Uh, Ruby? You
made a warm spot! Ah! A hot spot! Boiling! Uh, I'm gonna go back to the room.
- S-Sapphire? - Hello, Steven.
A-Are you d-d-doin' okay? - I'm fine.
- O-Okay.
- W-Wanna watch TV together? - Sure.
Huh.
The channels are all the wrong numbers.
Hey, can you use your future powers to predict what channel I'd love the most?
Hmm 43.
But there's not much on.
- Hey, Sapphire - Even if I do, Ruby won't listen.
- Huh? - You're going to say I should talk to Ruby, but it won't help.
- B-But she seems really upset.
- That doesn't matter.
We can't stay mad at Pearl forever, and she can't stay mad at me forever.
And then she'll come back and see that I'm right.
A-A-Are you s-sure? I can see the path of fate as it stretches toward the
horizon.
Ruby can't avoid the inevitable.
She's just letting her emotions get out of hand.
- N-N-Not you, though? - No.
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Also inevitable.
Uh, Sapphire? - The toilet's frozen.
- Such is fate.
Am I fated to pee outside on the grass, too? Yes.
"Keystone state" - Hey, Stu-ball, I brought dinner.
- Hey, Dad.
How'd it go? Well, he wasn't an axe murderer, so that was good.
What are you doing outside in your bathing suit? And where's Garnet? He's not
going to like that it's square.
Oh, boy.
Where's the other one? She's pacing around in what used to be the pool.
Something pretty serious must be going on if it made Garnet split up.
- But hey, we can still have a good time.
- Square pizza?! What's wrong with this crazy state?! Son, there'll come a time
in your life when you learn to accept all pizza.
Why can't Ruby and Sapphire just make up? Sometimes people that love each other
can hurt each other's feelings without meaning to.
We should just give them some space.
But I think they'd work it out if they'd just talk to each other.
Everything will be better in the morning.
We'll all go to the best diner in the world, where they'll eat the best
breakfast in the world.
You think that'll help? Nothing like a little breakfast to bring people
together.
You really are my favorite dad.
I knew this pizza would put me over the top.
- Hey! Thank you.
- Thanks! What's the matter? Not hungry? Gems don't need to eat, Dad.
- Eh, Garnet likes to eat sometimes.
- Ugh! Well, Garnet's not here! Mmm.
Oh, boy! This really is the best diner in the world! - You're shaking the
table.
- Oh?! Heh! I'm kinda surprised you felt anything at all, to be honest! I
didn't need to feel I saw.
Everything's just so crystal clear to you, isn't it?! This will pass.
She'll eventually just burn herself out.
That's what you think! I am an eternal flame, baby! You don't know me! Hey,
it's okay, pal! We can still save this! Why don't we just bag these up to go
and Ah, geez.
Steven! I was so happy when Garnet said she was gonna come on this trip with me
and dad! Home's been awful.
Here's been awful! I thought you wanted to have a fun time, but everyone's been
acting awful, too! It It just came with us.
I don't understand.
Is it Is it me? No! Steven, it's all us! But we made him feel like it was his
fault.
I keep looking into the future when all of this has already been solved, as if
it doesn't matter how you feel in the present.
No wonder you think I don't care! Sapphire! No, no, no, no, no! This is all my
fault! I-I didn't want to look for a solution.
I just wanted to be mad.
You're right.
You're always right.
- I was being stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid! I'm sorry.
You honestly think I'm not upset about what happened? - I was just trying to do
the right thing.
- I know.
You know what's nice about being split up? - What? - I get to look at you.
Pfft! - Be serious! - There's my laffy Saffy! Shh! You're embarrassing me in
front of Steven! Well, I paid for breakfast and the damage to the booth.
Anyhoo, I think I'm all vacationed out.
Ready to call it a day? - Not before we get our free ice! - Garnet! We're home!
I just don't know why I keep oh! - You look like you all had fun.
- Yeah, it all worked out! - Garnet, how are you? - Not now.
She's speaking to me again kind of.
- That really was a great trip.
- Can we go back? Maybe one day but not to that diner.
Oh, boy.

**** Onion Friend ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Onion Friend" Yes! Perfectly timed afternoon sandwich complete.
Wait, I can't eat such a perfect sandwich all on its own.
It needs a side.
But what? Oh, hey, Amethyst.
I made lunch.
- You want to eat this empty container? - No, thanks.
O-Okay.
You seen Garnet or Pearl? - Nope.
- Any idea where they might be? I don't know.
Somewhere not talking to each other.
Hmm.
Wait, I know what this meal needs.
A bag of Onion?! What the Oh, no, you don't.
Onion! We just put that screen in! Come back here! Those were going to complete
my perfect lunch! It's a special flavor that's only in stores for a limited
time! I know how you are with food! You're not even gonna eat them! At least
let me have just one! This is it, Onion.
Nowhere to hide.
Now just just drop the bag and Uh Onion? Uh Amethyst? Uh.
.
that's really weird! Um, so I always knew Onion was weird, but I think he's
obsessed with you? What do you think, Amethyst? Who's in there? Now, I don't
know how you got past that tarp, - but this is private property.
- Vidalia?! Amethyst?! It's been years! Man, you've changed.
You look terrible! You look the same terrible! Wait, what? Who's she? How do
you know each other? Oh, we both kind of hung around your dad, but Vidalia's
cooler than your dad, so we started hanging out without him.
Is that Steven? Look at him.
He looks just like Greg! That's good.
That's good.
He used to be super hot.
Uh, so did you paint these when you used to hang out? Yeah, some of them.
Some are new, though.
Amethyst was my favorite model.
Can you still turn into anything? Anything but respectable.
Oh, man, we used to get into all sorts of trouble.
Now tell me, Steven, aren't we just the spitting image of mischief? Hardly.
You're wearing slippers.
You don't know what I've done in these shoes.
It's great to see you again.
Sorry it's been so long.
I guess we've both been busy.
- Oh, yeah.
I get it kids.
- What about kids? Oh, here's one now.
- You're Onion's mom?! - Yep.
He's my little troublemaker.
And, Steven, he loves talking about you.
Oh, that's a great idea! Steven, Amethyst, Onion wants to know if you'd like to
stay for dinner.
- Um - We'd love to! Right, Steven? Onion's, like, your best friend.
Now, tell me what you did in those shoes, girl.
Mm, I can't eat another bite of whatever that was.
Oh, it's just a little dish I like to call noodles and butter.
I can't believe how long it's been.
I mean, check this guy out.
I used to be bigger than him.
Do you ever hear from old Farty Marty? Hm? I don't know where that fool is.
Don't care, either.
It's just been me and Yellowtail for a while now.
Whaaat?! Yellowtail? Yeah, things just kind of happened.
Next thing you know, I'm living with a fisherman.
You should see your face right now.
Hey, Sour Cream.
- I just didn't expect any of this.
- Well, that's just how it is now.
- So where's old fish tail at? - Uh, it's Yellowtail.
He spends a lot of time out at sea.
Hey, it's me.
Dude, you used to complain so much about the smell at the docks.
It used to be so gross over there.
Now there are all these fancy boats hanging around.
Remember when we snuck on to the mayor's boat and trashed it? - Why do you hate
food? - Yeah, I remember.
- What about you, Amethyst? - Huh? You haven't said a word about yourself all
night.
- Well, that's because my life is boring.
- All right, how are the Gems? I don't know.
They're boring, too.
Okay, thanks for dinner.
Time to go, right, Amethyst? What's the hurry? We got nothing to do.
'Sides, an Amethyst/Vidalia party don't end - till the sun come up.
- Ma-ma.
What's that? Oh, that's a great idea! Steven, Onion wants to show you around
the house.
What do you say? Can Onion tote you around? Uh W-What's going on? Oh, whenever
Sour Cream starts deejaying, it uses all the electricity in the house.
Good thing Yellowtail's not here it drives him nuts.
Dude, your house is jacked.
What can you do? Kids got to express themselves.
You too, Onion.
Very expressive.
Looks like he's ready for you, Steven.
Uh cool shopping cart.
Why don't you just jump up and down on that trampoline? I mean, it's, like,
right there.
But it's your room so do whatever you want.
You have a little mousy roommate friend! Aww! Oh.
Is that your pet? Oh, that must be where he lives, right? Let me help you put
him in his home.
This is a pretty large container for a little baby snake! Onion, you want me to
feed our little friend to this snake, huh? Oh.
Oh.
Sorry, but we all got to eat.
I can't! Ugh! Just take him from me! I-I'll be over here.
Uh You don't have any more weird pets to show me, do you? You gonna put on a
movie? That'd be nice and not creepy at all.
Cool hospital setting.
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Hey, that's your mom.
- I'm ready! - What's she getting ready for? Oh.
Oh, Yellowtail, I think Oh, it's happening! Ugh, wait! What's going on?! - Here
he comes! - Huh? "Happy birthday Onion.
" Is this you being born?! Oh, I am never doing this I can't take much more of
this.
Where? Okay, I'm out.
Can't do this anymore.
Need to go home.
Amethyst, I'm sorry, but it's time to Even Garnet, like, I've never seen Garnet
this upset.
It's awful at home.
I feel trapped.
That's crazy.
I know what you mean, though.
- You do? - Hey, we don't always get along in this family.
Yellowtail and Sour Cream are always at each other's throats.
It makes me nuts.
Actually, when I get like that, I think about you and how you could always just
roll with it.
What?! No! That was you! You were so cool.
I was just like a dumb sponge following you around.
But you were down for anything, not afraid of anything.
You know how much I wanted to be like you? Ugh.
I still think about it.
To be honest, that's why I started painting you again.
I'm I'm inspired by you, Amethyst.
Oh, looks like I'm gonna need more tea.
You want to eat this bag? Yeah, my favorite.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Good thing the kids are keeping themselves busy.
Okay, Onion, let's do this.
Whatever weird or horrible thing you have planned for me, I can take it.
Hey, slow down.
Oh, boy.
This is gonna be bad.
Uh, uh, Onion, where are you? What's this room? Oh! What's in there? Something
horrible? Onion! It's full of Guys! Wow! I've never seen this red variant of
Ninja Guy before.
You have gals, too?! Hard Hat Gal! Triangle Gal! Orange Gal! Karen! Karen How'd
you get a hold of No, don't tell me.
Hmm? No way! It's Explorer Gal! She's so cool-looking! Thanks for showing her
to me you you should take your Explorer Gal back.
Are you giving this to me? I can't believe it! Thank you so much, Onion! Aw,
man! What other Gals and Guys you got?! Ha, cool Invisible Guy.
And stay out.
Um, thanks for dinner and for listening.
Well, thanks for breaking into my house.
And don't worry about that other stuff.
It's gonna blow over.
You're a rock.
That's what you are, right? Uh, something like that.
Well, whatever you are, don't be a stranger.
Yeah, I can stop by anytime if you need inspiration.
Or if you want, you could come over to the Temple sometime, too.
You could even bring Onion for Steven to hang with.
Oh, well, that sounds great to us.
What about you, Steven? You ready for another round with this guy? Yeah, we'll
see.

And Steven! "Historical Friction" - Steven.
- Jamie! Safe.
We have fun.
So, you got the goods? Oh, I've got gooder than the goods.
Bum-da-da-dum-dum dum-da! - Wha? A play! - I'm holding auditions tonight.
It's a local production drifting through space, looking for stars.
If you need a great actor, you come to the right guy.
- What was that? - An accent.
- From where? - I don't know.
Acting.
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
Where's everyone else? Uh, you're the only one that showed up.
But, hey, some plays only have one person in them, so we're already in 200%
better shape than that.
That sounds like some strange math - nut I'm ready.
- Great.
Here's a copy of the script.
"Beach City or bust: The tale of William Dewey.
" This is my first production, so it needs to be exciting.
It needs to be classic.
It needs to be fully funded by Mayor Dewey.
And it is because he wrote it.
- What's it about? - I'm glad you asked.
This is the story of how Beach City was founded nearly great-great-great-great
grandfather, William Dewey.
It's a truly important historical tale with a lot of sentimental and political
importance to me.
Well, we're just about to get started.
Uh, would you like to sit in on the rehearsal, mayor? Don't mind if I do.
Oh, pardon me.
Okay, Steven.
Since you're the only one who showed up, you'll be playing the lead role of
William Dewey.
Nailed the audition! And for the other roles, I guess I'll have to play all of
them.
The ship is out at sea.
The sun beats down on the crew while they stand on deck.
Suddenly, the tall, ruggedly handsome man standing in front of them speaks
"Crew, I'm so glad you could be part of this journey with me as we search for a
new land to build a distinguished new city in.
"Oh, Captain William Dewey, you're such a good captain.
Never has a voyage been so super good.
" "Good point, first mate buddy.
" For fun.
Oh, no.
Is that a wild squall approaching us? - Surely this can't be good.
- "Be calm, my crew.
" I'll just save us with my heroic, supernatural ability.
" And then William Dewey grows into a 50-Foot giant and carries the boat safely
to shore.
The crew thinks he's so good at being captain that they elected him to be the
first mayor of Beach City.
The end.
Wow, Mayor Dewey.
That was really good.
Yeah.
William Dewey is a really, uh, good character but maybe we could bring out
another side of William Dewey? - See his struggles? - The great William Dewey
didn't struggle.
He was good at everything on the first try just like me when I wrote this play.
Not a single word needs to be changed.
- But maybe - Don't forget who's funding this.
Well, nice hustle, gentlemen.
- Keep it up.
- Aye, aye.
- This is gonna be a disaster.
- What? It's a terrible story.
William Dewey is totally unbelievable.
- 'Cause he grows 50 feet? - No, he's got no character.
But the script kept saying he was really good.
Exactly.
How can a guy have no faults? To be human is to be flawed.
A real hero must struggle.
That's so beautiful.
And, also, totally not represented in Mayor Dewey's script.
My first play and probably my last.
Hey, Pearl.
- Pearl? - Steven, you're back.
Yeah.
Show business is rough.
Is there something I can help you with? Not unless you can make William Dewey
interesting.
- How do you know William Dewey? - I'm gonna be him in this play.
But he's totally boring.
He's perfect, and he never makes mistakes.
Wish I could say the same for myself.
Yeah, but nobody's like that.
Everybody gets stuff wrong.
And then you have to keep going, and it's hard, which is why it's great when
you never stop trying.
When did you get so smart? Hmm.
This isn't just boring.
It's historically inaccurate.
- Who wrote this? - Mayor Dewey.
He wasn't even there.
- But I was.
- You were there? - Wait, what really happened? - Well, for starters, "ruggedly
handsome" seems rather generous.
Steven this is so real! It's like it was written by someone who lived it! It
was.
And I don't know if you can tell, - but I wrote the jokes.
- I can tell.
- It's so gritty, so passionate, so - Historically accurate? And the drama? -
This is the play we should be doing.
- Let's do it then.
- Let's put on this version of the play.
- But how? We'd need new costumes, new props we have no time.
And Mayor Dewey will have our heads.
But Jamie, you said it yourself "a real hero struggles.
" By jiminy, you're right.
This show will go on tomorrow night with you as Captain William Dewey - and I
as the remaining roles.
- All of them? All of them.
Boom, ahh, acting.
- Mind if I have a seat? - Okay Oh, you know, I wrote this play.
I hope Mayor Dewey isn't mad about the changes Guess we'll have to see.
- Are you nervous? - Of course.
This could either make or break my career.
You could lose your job at the post office? This could either make or break my
hobby.
- Acting.
- Acting.
Boardies and gentleboardies, tonight, I am thrilled to present to you "The tale
of William Dewey.
" - Yeah Beach City rules.
- Shh.
Oh, captain, my captain, how long until the soft lips of our sailing ship kiss
the rugged beard of new lands? I know we've been journeying for many months,
but surely we'll run into something soon.
The ocean can't be that big.
There he is.
Hi, Steven! You're so talented.
Back home they called me "Dewey the dunce," said I couldn't find land even if I
was standing on it.
What the And I'm starting to fear that they were right.
What light through yon stage left breaks? Oh, what now? It is the East, and we
are the Crystal Gems.
What? This wasn't in the script.
This wasn't in the budget, either.
Greetings.
I am Pearl.
And I come to you as a messenger of the brilliant, Rose Quartz.
We ask that you turn your ship around.
The land you are headed for is no walk in the park for your species.
Nonsense.
I won't take orders from the likes of you.
Well, then You should turn around lest you fall into the sea.
And you know, humans aren't very good swimmers.
They ain't.
I'll just return home like the failure dunce I am.
Ugh.
I can't even turn a sail right.
Why must I always struggle? Wow, Dad, what a loser.
Oh, captain, my captain, we've drifted miles from our course.
These waves are nothing like I've ever seen before.
Nonsense.
This is only a drizzle.
Okay, maybe a light summer storm.
What's that portside? - Lever.
- Oh.
- Captain, it's got me! - First mate buddy.
Whatever you do, don't give up your search.
You're the bravest man I know, because you try, even though you fail so, so
much.
Buddy, noooo! Oh, buddy, a stale biscuit to the end.
And now my boat will sink into the depths.
Dewey the disastrous dunce.
What's this? Holy anchovies.
The quadruple noogie.
A move that's only been spoken of in legends.
Ah.
It heads this way.
Oh, please, goddess of noogies, don't hurt me.
Whoa.
I've made it! Land! Sweet, solid land! Ugh.
Thank you, giant woman.
You may not want to stay, this land is dangerous.
No, I will stay.
For I am William Dewey, and I don't give up in the face of failure.
That's what makes me great.
Very well then.
But I can't promise you I won't interfere again.
I shall name this new land in honor of my dead first mate, buddy.
- I'm alive.
- Okay, Beach City it is.
What? Nice to know great grandpa was a real person with flaws.
- Gutsy move Dad.
- Mayor Dewey! Mayor Dewey! Mayor - One for you, and one for you - Excuse me.
If I could have a moment with the talent.
- Oh.
- Jamie.
Oh, yeah.
Fantastic work.
I loved the message.
"Vote Mayor Dewey.
" How about I offer you another role lead director of Beach City Community
Theater.
You could put on more plays as long as the budget allows it.
- Uh, thank you, sir.
- A lot of the credit should go to Pearl.
You could say she was an "inside source.
" I am a Gem of many talents a dedication to fact is just one of them.
Thank you for preserving my legacy.
- Oh, what's 200 years between friends.
- Well I must be off then to bask in the adulation of my constituents.
You know, I don't remember there being a campaign slogan at the end of that
story.
Art doesn't always need a reason, Pearl.
Sometimes it's just gotta make the audience happy.
That's why you always end on a joke.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e18 Episode Script ******
**** Friend Ship ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Friend Ship" Stupid broken warp.
First the communication hub.
Now this is busted again.
These Crystal Gems are a menace.
Oh, aha! Look! I was right! - My plan worked perfectly.
- Good morning.
What? How did you know I was here? We found a secret way to track you and we'll
never tell you how even if you ask nicely.
Nyeh! - Peridot! We're here to - And you'll never get away with this! Don't you
Gems have anything better to do than annoy me? - Nope.
We're gonna - Prepare to be annoyed.
I don't have time for this! This planet has an expiration date, and I'm not
gonna stick around to find out when! Wha? Uh - That's it.
I'm taking her out.
- Pearl, wait! Ha! Sorry.
But you're going the wrong way! Get her! You missed.
- Pearl! - Huh? Ah, doesn't anything work on this cruddy planet? - I do! - Huh?
Ow! Amethyst, catch! Destroy! I got her! I got her! I got her! - Pearl! Oh, get
off me! - I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Wow.
This is just sad.
I almost feel sorry for you.
Nyeh! Have a great weekend.
I mean, I hope her weekend is not so great? Okay, I realize that was a bit of a
fiasco.
But there's a silver lining to this.
Now we know for sure that we can track her every movement.
Whenever she uses the warp system, her escape pod will instantly detect exactly
where she is.
It's only a matter of time until we catch her, and when we do, we'll be able to
close this chapter and finally move on, right? Isn't there something that maybe
the two of you might need to talk about? It's Peridot.
She's using the warps right now.
Look.
This is where she is.
We got her for sure this time.
If she thinks she's got the upper hand, then she has another thing coming, and
that's us.
- Well, at least Pearl's optimistic.
- It won't help.
She could hand Peridot over on a silver platter, but it won't make up for the
stunt she pulled to get Garnet to fuse with her.
Steven, let's go.
- Whoa.
- Ha! She's desperate.
Look at this.
She's cornered herself in there.
Hmm.
We've got her just where we want her.
- What is - Excellent question, Steven.
What we see before us is an ancient interplanetary Gem vessel.
Homeworld Gems used these ships to travel across the cosmos and land here on
Earth before the warp pads were built.
But these ships landed here so long ago that there's no way they can be
functional.
Peridot's running out of options.
Pearl, we can't waste time.
- Let's focus on the task at - Ah, yes.
The task at hand.
No more doddling.
Let's go get Peridot! It's more like a greenhouse than a spaceship.
Looks like Earth won this battle.
Oh.
You Gems really are as dull as dirt.
You're the dull one if you think you can fly this wreck.
What? Can you speak louder? Some of these communicators are gunked up.
Pearl says you're the dull one if you think you can fly this wreck.
Fly this wreck.
Fly? I'm not using this vessel to fly.
I'm using it to trap you! Isn't this nice? No more Crystal Gems running around,
messing with my plans, destroying my things.
Looks like I've got you just where I want you.
How does it feel to be so easily outsmarted, you clods?! - No.
- Hey, uh this is Amethyst.
I don't appreciate being called a clod, you clo Enough talk.
Prepare yourselves for annihilation! Hyah! Hyah.
Aha! It works.
Yes! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Hey, guys,
over here.
This way.
You're on fire, Steven! That's three shields in one day.
Not too shabby! Move! Spikes! How do you like my spikes?! - Peridot! - Pearl,
don't just You idiot.
- Pearl, stop.
That isn't helping.
- I have to do something.
I can't believe I walked us right into Peridot's trap.
This is all my fault? Huh? Huh? - I got you, Steven.
- Thanks, Amethyst.
Garnet and Pearl.
Are you guys okay? We're fine.
Crud.
We've got to get them out.
Amethyst, what should we - Garnet, I'm sorry.
- Wait a sec.
Things weren't supposed to turn out this way.
We'll get out of here somehow.
That's not what I mean.
I really wanted to catch Peridot to make up for what I did.
I wanted to prove to you that that everything could go back to normal.
Catching Peridot won't make things go back to normal.
This isn't about Peridot.
Hey, they're actually talking.
Now they can finally work things out.
Not if they get crushed! Please tell me! How can I make you forgive me?! You
can't.
You lied to me.
You need to learn that there are consequences to your actions.
I'm sorry.
I I couldn't help myself.
- I don't want to hear your excuses.
- But it's true.
No matter how hard I try to be strong like you, I'm just a Pearl.
I'm useless on my own.
I need someone to tell me what to do.
When we fuse, I can feel what it's like to be you.
Confident and secure and complete.
You're perfect.
You're the perfect relationship.
You're always together.
I just I wanted to be a part of that.
You're wrong.
I'm not as strong as you think.
I-I fell apart over this.
Ruby and sapphire were in turmoil over how you deceived me.
I came undone.
- Whoa.
That really happened? - Hmm.
It's not easy being in control.
I have weaknesses, too, but I choose not to let them consume me.
I struggle to stay strong because I know the impact I have on everyone.
Please understand, Pearl, you have an impact, too.
There are times when I look up to you for strength.
You are your own Gem.
You control your destiny.
Not me, not Rose, not Steven.
But you must choose to be strong so we can move forward, so I can trust you
again.
I understand.
I can't give up anymore.
Good.
Pearl, there's only one way out of this.
- Only if you're okay with it.
- Mm.
What do we do?! What do we do?! What do we do?! What do we do?! Stupid button
here.
I don't know what anything is Blast this old Gem tech! Where did they go? Why
isn't anything working?! Surrender, Peridot.
You have nowhere to run.
The Crystal Gems are gonna get you.
You really think this is the end? This This is only the beginning of my escape.
Well, I'd love to stick around and watch another one of your pathetic attempts
to capture me, but I guess I'm just too smart for the likes of you lumpy,
clumpy clods.
- What the? - I caught a Peridot.
Hey, get your touch stumps off me, you Steven.
- Hey! - Yeah, Steven! Don't let her go.
Let go of me! You You persistent, little whatever exactly you are! Peridot,
your flight's been canceled.
No! You'll pay for this, Crystal Gems.
I'll get you back.
Just you wa-a-a-it! - Pearl? - It's okay, Steven.
Next time, we'll get the rest of her.
Right, Garnet? - It's a good step forward.
- Foot joke! Finally.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e19 Episode Script ******
**** Nightmare Hospital ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # That's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # And Pearl #
And Steven! "Nightmare Hospital" Well, time to assume my secret identity.
Same time next week for sword training? Yeah.
It's a shame I can't practice more at home.
Hey, wait a sec.
Hup! May I? Here-eth.
You can borrow-eth my mother's sword eth.
Steven, that's so nice, if grammatically incorrect.
But thou can't just givest me thine mother's sword.
- Why not-eth? - Because it's really important-eth.
That's exactly why you should have-eth it.
You can have all week to practice-eth with it-eth.
Pbbhh-thank you.
We got to be ready if we have to fight Malachite or Peridot or those creepy
gem-fusion experiments.
I'll make sure nothing happens to it.
That's the garage door.
Mom's home! We have to hide the sword.
There's no way mom would let me have this in the house.
Lion? Lion? - He walked off.
- What are we gonna do?! Hi, Mom.
Just finishing my 6:00 violin practice.
You should have finished five minutes ago.
You're late for your 7:00 study hour.
- Hello, Steven.
- Hi, Dr.
Maheshwaren.
- How are you? - Sitting! I had a rough day at work, and I'm not in the mood
for any more surprises.
What happened at work? There was a really strange case at the hospital today
straight out of a nightmare.
Oh, don't worry.
The rules of doctor-patient confidentiality keep me from sharing the graphic
details, but Hang on a moment.
When did we get a coat rack? - Oh, no.
- A sword?! Connie, where did you get this?! - It's - I found it.
I just found it outside, and I wanted to show it to Steven.
- How could you possibly think this is okay? - It's Do you know how many
children I see every day in the hospital who've cut their faces off playing
with swords? - I - None! Because they all have parents who love them and who
don't let them play around with deadly weapons like some kind of gang member!
No playing with swords under any circumstances.
This is Dr.
Maheshwaren.
Yes, calm down, Straumburg.
- Another one? - Is she gonna give it back? All right, I'll I'll be right
there.
I have to go to the hospital.
I'll have a talk with your father to calculate just how grounded you are.
And we're using the abacus.
I hate that abacus.
Steven, I'm so sorry.
She took your mother's sword.
Maybe we can get her to change her mind.
She never, ever changes her mind.
We've got to get that sword back ourselves.
Whoa! - Ugh.
- We can't bring lion inside.
I'd feel really bad if my mom confiscated him, too.
Oh, it's no problem.
He can stay out here.
Look I finally found a way to get him to do what I want.
- He didn't even take the plastic off.
- What an animal.
- Okay, serious.
- Yeah.
Serious.
This way.
Ah, you mean the super scary way.
- They turn the lights down after dinner.
- What was that? Dr.
West ain't gonna like it.
Well, Dr.
West isn't here.
Yes, yes, I just got here.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Where did you say you found them? The side of the road? I'm not sure just yet.
I haven't had a look for myself.
It doesn't look like a car accident.
You didn't find an I.
D.
? Listen, I'll call you back when, or if, I have an answer for you.
Goodbye.
Okay, now.
- What's she doing? - She's probably checking their vitals.
Haven't you been to a hospital before? - No.
- Oh.
Lucky.
- Steven, look.
- Hmm.
Hmm.
No heartbeat.
Ugh.
Cheap hospital budgets.
- Connie! - Oh, no! How did you even What are you doing with this?! I made a
rule no swords under any circumstances.
- But, Mom! - We will finish this conversation at home.
Sir? Ma'am? Dr.
West? He can't take a day off, can he? You? It's my other patient.
What are you doing out of bed? Why aren't you with Dr.
Straumburg? That's not a patient.
I don't know what's going on here, but I am going to get to the bottom of it.
Connie, I think that's one of the gem mutants.
- What? Are you sure? - Pretty sure at this point.
Mom, I really, really, really need that sword.
Connie, no.
Now is not the time.
Now is the perfect time, Mom! Connie, what has gotten into you? You know I
never go back on a rule, young lady.
There have to be some exceptions.
I'm not some rule-driven robot.
- Connie! - Mom! I'll save you! Here! Keep your hands off my Connie! These
patients are beyond reason.
Mom, if you would just go back on your rule this one time I just need to help
Steven to get us out of here! Mother knows best! Steven, come on! - Oh, no.
- We're trapped.
We don't have to be.
Really, Mom, I know how to do this.
- No, you don't.
- Ugh! Yes, she does.
She's been training.
She wasn't playing around with that sword.
She was taking classes, learning how to use it right.
Even though she's always studying or practicing tennis or doing her homework,
she still works really hard to be a good sword fighter.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I know my daughter.
I know what she's doing every second of the day all her activities, all her
internets.
I know she's definitely not some sword-fighting hooligan.
You don't know me at all! You still haven't even noticed my glasses.
- What's wrong with your glasses? - They don't have lenses anymore.
I haven't needed actual glasses for almost a year.
What? Your eyesight just magically got better? Yes! I've been dealing with
magic and monsters and things like these since I met Steven.
That's why I need you to believe I know what to do here.
- But you - Ugh! There's no time for this.
- Ready? - Drop the bubble.
Ha! So that's why it had no pulse.
Gem experiments.
This is what you've been doing? Training to fight these things? Sorry, Dr.
Maheshwaren.
That's my lion.
Mom, I'm really sorry about lying to you.
It started off as a tiny secret, and then it felt like if I didn't hide it, you
wouldn't let me see Steven ever again.
Is that how you feel? Are we too controlling? - Maybe.
- I just wanted to be a good mother.
I-I just wanted to protect you.
I can protect myself now.
Okay.
We'll pull back on the rules, and I'll try to keep an open mind about this and
that and him.
It scares me that you can't talk to me.
I need to know what's happening in your life.
I-I need to step in when you're in over your head.
Will you just promise me you'll stop all this lying? - That's a rule.
- I love you, honey.
I love you too, Mom.

So, um, do you need something? Oh! I'm just going around helping Mr.
Smiley hand out fliers for Beach-a-Palooza this year.
- You should sign up! - Ehh, why? Ehh because your voice is beautiful! Aw,
anybody'd sound fine singing along with that song.
It's so cheesy and dumb and and catchy.
- And I know every single word.
- Perfect! Now you just need a routine.
- I can help you put one together.
- Aw, really? You think people would want to hear me sing? Of course they
would! You're great! Besides, everyone in town is doing something! Yeah.
You know what? Yeah! Who cares, right? What am I afraid of? Th-This could be
fun! Your house is so cool.
- Just down here.
- Whoa! You sleep in a basement? - I like to think of it like a bunker.
- Are these all yours? Yeah, but they're not really my thing.
You can have one if you want.
Ehhhhh I don't want to break up a family.
So, now we have the CD.
I guess I can practice singing.
First, we got to figure out what you're gonna wear.
- Does it matter? - Ever since my act two years ago, there's been a rule that
you've got to wear clothes.
Well, I wasn't planning to go in my underwear.
How about something flashy? And sparkly.
O-Or wait, what do you think should be your gimmick? Whoa.
No, no, no.
No gimmicks.
The singing's already a stretch.
Well, maybe this? - Or maybe even - That one's pretty! Eh, I think it's a
little much.
I'll just do something comfortable.
- What's that?! - We'll do this another time! - Hey, Sadie! - Hi, Mom.
You're home early.
I just had to rush home to show you this! Look at this little guy I got for
you! - Ain't he the cutest? - Oh.
Thanks mom.
Sadie, what are you doing hanging out with Greg's boy? Barb, I knew you
delivered mail, but I didn't know you delivered Sadie! - Yeah, my mom's the
mailman.
- That she is! Best dang mailman, woman, or animal on the force! At least until
they catch me taking from the "lost mail" bin! But that's between us, heh? So,
Steven, what are your intentions with my daughter? We're planning a stage show
for Beach-a-Pawooza.
Beach-a-Pawooza! Beach-a-Pawooza! Beach-a-Pawooza! What was that? I'm going to
sing a song for Beach-a-Palooza.
What?! Oh, oh, oh oh! Sadie, you're gonna sing?! - Yeah.
- Then come on! We have to start planning now! - Steven, help me find an
outfit! - Okay! Uh, you know, I could probably do this by myself.
It's no trouble.
We'd love to help ya out! - Right, Steven? - Right! Oh, look! It's your old
ballet outfit! - You're a ballerina? - When I was like 10.
Oh, it's your swimsuit! She used to be a competitive swimmer! For like a month.
When I was 11.
- Barb, what's this? - Oh! Look, look! Remember when I used to drive you to
your softball games? - I remember when you punched the umpire.
- That's what he gets for trying to cheat my daughter out of a double! And then
I wasn't really allowed in the league anymore.
Them's the breaks! So what have you got planned so far for your show? -
Nothing, I guess.
- Well, don't you worry! Me and Steven will figure out your show for you! We'll
make sure the world will hear your voice! - Well, let's just try to keep it
simple? - What was that? I can't help it if I make a scene Stepping out of my
hot-pink limousine I'm turning heads, and I'm stopping traffic When I pose,
they scream, and when I joke, they laugh I've got a pair of eyes that they're
getting lost in They're hypnotized by the way I'm walking I've got them dazzled
like a stage magician When I point, they look, and when I talk, they listen
Well, everybody needs a friend And I've got you and you and you So many, I
can't even name them Can you blame me? I'm too famous I think we did an
excellent job! We just need to tell Mr.
Smiley to add her name to the flier.
Oh, maybe don't put my name on it.
Yeah! What if she was a surprise?! That's a great idea! She'll be a mystery
final act! Thank you, Beach-a-Palooza! You know this next act from their day
job, delivering pizza! But tonight, they're delivering jokes! That was a joke.
Let me hear a big round of applause for Kiki and her ventriloquist dummy! Kiki,
that rude Mr.
Smiley just called me a dummy! That's just our act, gunga! Why don't you show
them your jokes? How does a pizza tie its shoes? - How? - With a garlic knot!
All right.
Well, we're getting closer to tonight's mystery guest.
Even I don't know who it is, and I'm the host! But first, Ronaldo Fryman with a
lecture on "rock people: identification and defense.
" I can't believe it.
The fliers really worked! The whole town is here! Plus some! Oh, my Sadie! Such
a big star! Never even went to the prom and look at ya now! Am I on yet? Sadie
Miller! You're the mystery guest? - I never even would've recognized you! - Oh!
Hi, Mr.
Smiley.
Uh, um Mm.
How, uh, how are you? I'm fine, but it looks like someone here has a case of
the showbiz shakes.
You know what an old friend of mine told me once? A little smile never hurt
anybody.
- Nnnnnn.
- Nnnnn.
Awwww, lookin good! - Thank you! - Thank you! Gah-ah.
- More sparkles! - Yes, sir! Next up, ladies and gentlemen, your mailman and
"mime!" Jamie! Oh, it's a box.
He's he's he's doing a box.
Uh-oh.
No more glitter.
I'll have to run and get the emergency supply from the car.
- Guard my girl, Steven.
- Sadie, come back here! - I can't wait for this mystery act! - You think it's
a juggler? Maybe they'll juggle something sharp.
I'm gonna have my phone ready in case someone gets hurt.
- Sadie! - Uh! I-I can't breathe! Okay, okay, if you're not gonna come back and
let me work on you, then let's work on the routine.
- Okay, just let me - Oh, no! You ruined my lipstick! Never fear! Steven's
here! - Sadie, why did you do that? - Because! - You're just as bad as my mom!
- What?! Please, mom, don't make me do this.
Make you? You said you wanted to sing! Yeah! I did! I did! I did! I did! Just
like I say lots of things! Like, "hey, mom, swimming looks fun!" Then bam!
Suddenly, I'm anchoring a 400-meter relay for the Beach City Seals! "Hey, mom,
I thought signing up for softball would be nice!" Six birthdays later, I'm
still getting nothing but kneepads and batting helmets! "Hey, mom, I want to
sing in this year's Beach-a-Palooza," And what do I get? This! I just thought
for once, I'd get to do things my way, but you came in and took over
everything, like you always do.
I just wanted everyone to know how talented my daughter is.
This is not your daughter.
I'm sorry.
I Next up, the one you've all been waiting for.
The one! The only! Mystery guest! How did I let this happen? I don't want to do
this! You never did.
I-It was always me.
Give it up for Looks like you called it, gunga.
That "mystery guest" bit had Steven written all over it.
I can't help it if I make a scene Stepping out of my hot-pink limousine I'm
turning heads, and I'm stopping traffic When I pose, they scream, and when I
joke, they laugh I've got a pair of eyes that they're getting lost in They're
hypnotized by my way of walking I've got them dazzled like a stage magician
When I point, they look, and when I talk, they listen Well, everybody needs a
friend And I've got you and you and you So many, I can't even name them Can you
blame me? I'm too famous Haven't you noticed I'm a star? I'm coming into view

# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #

[Spits.]
Ahh.
Good night, Happy Bear.
Good night, Sad Bunny.
Good night, Playful Kitty.
Good night, Ominous Triangle at the foot of my bed.
[Sighs.]
Whatever.
[Muffled scream.]
Ah! Let me go! [Both grunt.]
Enough of this.
[Sighs.]
What do you want from me? I want to get off this lousy gem-forsaken planet!
Huh? Ah! - You have to fix this.
- Wait, what? You're my last chance.
I've got no flask robonoids.
I've got no foot.
I've got no response from yellow diamond.
[Inhales deeply, exhales.]
I know you fixed Lazuli's gem.
Whatever you did, you've got to do it to the homeworld warp.
- Or else! - Uh, okay.
Just Just give me a second.
My mouth gets really dry when I'm scared.
Here goes.
What was that? It didn't do anything! - It doesn't always work.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no! It has to work! I'm really sorry.
[Laughing.]
This was it.
This was my last shot.
[Gasps.]
I'm gonna die here.
- Ohhh.
- Hey, hey, come on.
Earth isn't that bad.
It doesn't matter what Earth is like.
- It's not going to be like anything soon.
- What do you mean? [Warbles.]
[Groans.]
- There he is.
- Guys! - What happened? - Oh, you're okay! - Peridot! - Why can't you just
leave me alone? Gems, move! Yah! Ha! Not this time.
Whoa! [Gasps.]
[Coughs, groans.]
Wait, wait.
You You need me.
- I'm the only one who knows about the - Rraaah! What on Earth? Ugh, sick.
There's bits of her all over.
Nope.
She's right here.
And now she's in the temple.
So, these weren't actually part of her body? Uh, whoops.
Garnet, she was trying to tell us something.
Those are just the desperate lies of a gem who's been caught.
You don't need to worry about her anymore.
Come on, Steven.
Oh, I'm so glad this is finally over.
[Sighs.]
[Gasps.]
I'm back to kidnap you! What? [Chuckles.]
It's been long enough that we can joke about it, right? It's only been like an
hour.
So, ew, what are you doing with her foot? - Think it's lucky? - Not for
Peridot.
[Laughs.]
Well, glad to have you back.
- Um Amethyst? - Yeah? Uh do you think - No, it's okay.
Never mind.
- Okay, weirdo.
If you need anything, I'll be in my room eating garbage.
Okay.
[Sighs.]
Why were you so scared? What were you going to say? Now you're deep in the
temple in a bubble and we'll never know.
If I could just talk to you for one more second [Gasps.]
[Warbles.]
Room, I need to talk to Peridot.
I'm the only one who knows about the The what?! Ugh.
No, no, no.
Room, I need to go to the basement.
The real basement.
I know there's a way down from here.
Thank you! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Triple 550 deluxe with no cheese! [Grunts.]
[Strained.]
Yep.
Perfect landing.
Hmm [Gasps.]
There we go.
[Grunting.]
Gotcha! Whoa! the cluster, you insufferable, half-formed, traitor megaclods!
Oh, my gosh! You're so cute! My limb enhancers! Where are my limb enhancers?!
Aww! You're like an angry little slice of pie.
Stop talking.
I demand to know what this place is and where I Oh, my stars.
You're going to harvest me? No.
I-I mean - Ow! That hurt! - It did? Yeah.
A lot.
- Ow! - Yes! Feel my unbridled rage! [Both grunting.]
Hey! Hey, hey.
- What's that on your shirt? - What's a shirt? Ow! [Laughs.]
That's it! [Both grunting.]
Why are you acting like this? You smashed me into a limbless cloud! You trapped
me in your bubble dungeon! And you called me cute! - Nyah! - I didn't poof you.
I freed you.
Why would you make such a miscalculation? Back at the warp pad, what were you
trying to say? Why do we need you? What do you know? What do I know? Everything
there is to know about the cluster, you pebble.
- Cluster? Wait, pebble? - My mission, the reason why I'm on this sad rock in
the first place.
I was to check progress on the cluster.
Just in and out before it hatches.
I wasn't supposed to get stuck here.
But now it's going to emerge and nothing can stop it, and we'll all be
shattered! Okay, okay.
Wait, slow down.
Now, from the top.
Emerging, hatching clusters.
- You want to know? - Yes.
- You really want to know? - Yes.
- What's your shirt? - These are my banana pajamas Ow! Wait, don't run away!
[Both grunting.]
Nyah! [Laughing.]
Stop! They're gonna see you! Freedom is mine! Wait! Look, over there! Another
planet to betray! [Chomps.]
Retreat! - Oh, no you don't! - Eep! - Hey.
- Aaah! - Aah - Get her! You may have won the war, but the battle isn't over,
crystal clods! [Laughs.]
- Should we tell her that's the bathroom? - Eh.
Hmm.
Seems I discovered some sort of archaic think chamber.
Roomy, with a fresh hint of Earth citrus.
A perfect crossroads for my escape.
- It's locked.
- Peridot, open the door! [Toilet flushes.]
Uh, if you're trying to flush yourself down the toilet, it won't work.
Trust me.
I've tried.
How did she get out? We bubbled her.
- Maybe we needed a bigger bubble.
- My bubbles are fine.
- I did it.
[Gasps.]
- Steven, why would you do such a thing? Because she knows something, Something
that's made her scared.
Duh.
Homegirl knows we're gonna beat her into a green pancake.
No, not 'cause of us.
'Cause of something called "the cluster.
" - Cluster? That's new.
- What else did she tell you? - That's all I got.
- That's right, you dirt bombs! You don't even know what's coming.
Oh! I'm tired of playing these games.
If we can't fight her, then fine.
- We'll talk.
Peridot! - Whoa! All right, no more fighting.
Let's just have a civil conversation.
As if I'd negotiate with you, filthy war machine! - Okay, let's kick her butt.
- Wait! Peridot: Yeah, destroy me again.
And have fun trying to talk to me when I'm in a bubble.
[Grunts.]
I really hate to say it, but unfortunately, if she has information, she's more
valuable to us like this.
This is going to be tricky.
[Shower runs.]
Peridot: Hot, hot, hot, hot! You have to turn the knob the other way for cold.
Wait, so we're just gonna let her live in my bathroom? Well, yes.
What other option do we have? Keep her outside on a leash? [Laughs.]
- Hmm.
- But I need to use the bathroom.
- Right now? - Yeah, kinda.
Just go in the ocean, bro.
Psssh! Like a fish.
What's with you guys and making me pee outside?! Well, I have fun doing it.
Oh, but even if we do get her to come out of the bathroom she's never gonna
talk to us.
[yawns.]
Garnet: Looks like there's not much else we can do right now.
We have her in Peridot, can I come in? I need to get ready for the day.
- Peridot: No.
- I have something for you.
Garnet: If it has anything to do with the experiment she was conducting in the
kindergarten, then very.
What a great souvenir of that other time you assaulted me.
Oh, right.
Sorry.
I can take it back.
No, it's too late.
You wouldn't happen to have the rest? Uh, sorry.
We lost them.
Well, we kind of threw them away.
Can you pass me that? - Is this a weapon? - Only for cavities.
- Hmm.
- Thanks.
- Is that a weapon? - No.
That's a comb I never use.
Is that a weapon? Hmm? Oh, well, I guess if you get it wet and roll it up.
Aah! Look, I know you're scared, but I'm not going to hurt you.
And whatever's going on, whatever the cluster is, I wanna help.
I doubt you can help me.
But I appreciate the offer.
Now, do you mind moving? I have to use that.
For what?

door.]
Open the door, Peridot.
If this "Cluster" is putting us in danger, you need to tell us what it is so we
can stop it.
No! I hate you.
I'm not telling you anything about the Cluster" Oh, come on.
Is it like a big, uh, hunk of granola? What's granola? I'm sure it's not
granola.
Now, Peridot, I'm sure we can reach some sort of agreement.
Perhaps a trade is in order? Oh, sure.
Why don't you just give me back my leg enhancements and my arm attachments with
my screen and my log and all my information.
Oh, wait, you destroyed them! So, no, I don't think we can reach some sort of
agreement! [All sigh.]
[Toilet flushes.]
Okay, Peridot, you can turn around now.
[Grunts.]
[Clears throat.]
Sorry for interrupting your interrogation.
Don't worry about it, Steven.
I swear, Peridot is gonna crack any second now.
Peridot: I'll never crack for the likes of you, you crystal clods.
[Laughs.]
Ooh, I got your clods right here, you little Hold on, Pearl.
If she's not gonna be of any help.
- Let's investigate this thing on our own.
- I'll come with you.
Sorry, Steven.
We're gonna need you to stay here - and keep an eye on our guest.
- Really? Yeah.
Make sure she doesn't try anything.
Don't worry.
She's harmless without her limb enhancers.
Peridot: I'm not harmless! - Oh, hush up! - Oh, Steven! There's one more thing
I have to mention.
What is it? - I love you.
Bye.
- See ya later.
Mm.
[Thunder rumbles.]
They left, you know.
You can come out now.
No.
I-I like it in here.
Okay.
Wow.
It's really coming down.
[Thunder crashes.]
- It's happening! - What? - The Cluster! - Really? What else could be making
that horrible [Thunder crashes.]
Aah! It's pounding on the Earth from the inside.
This is it.
This is the end of the world.
[Whimpers.]
- Oh, that's just thunder.
- What? Yeah, everything is fine.
It's just thunder.
It happens when it rains.
- Eh huh? - You don't know about rain? I don't know anything without my screen.
It's okay.
Here, pretend this soup is the ocean.
When the sun warms it up, the water evaporates into clouds, like this steam.
And when the clouds get really heavy, it rains.
So scalding liquid pours down from the sky? No, no, it's just water.
It can't hurt you.
Here, why don't I just show you.
- Whoo-hoo! - Steven, wait! - Uh oh - Come on! [Laughs.]
Look, I'm okay.
It's just water.
This is just something that happens on Earth.
Isn't it cool? [Laughs.]
Whoa! Wah! [Laughs.]
Yeah! Whoo-hoo! [music.]
Yeah, you did it! What do you think? Isn't it cool? [Laughs.]
Cool.
That was fun.
Huh? It was something.
Hmm.
Uh Mm - Steven? - Hm? I'm going to say something.
- Thank you.
- Uh what for? For explaining this "rain" business to me.
Oh, no problem.
[Chuckles.]
Yes.
You're a much more intelligent creature than I initially thought.
- Uh, that's good.
- Yes.
Much more useful than those clods.
- Steven, I've made up my mind! - About what, exactly? I've decided to share
some information with you.
- Ah, I know you use my toothbrush.
- N-No.
Well, yes.
But it's about the Cluster.
- [Gasps.]
You cracked.
- I haven't cracked! Wait, you have to tell the gems! They need to know this!
No, I don't want to talk to them! You're the only one I need.
I could show you now, but I have nothing! My arm attachments, my fingers, my
screen, my log it's all gone.
But all of my logs up to date 652 still exist.
Backed up in Facet 5 of the Prime Kindergarten.
You want me to take you to the Kindergarten? I don't know.
Steven, don't you want to know about the Cluster? Mm okay.
- We can go to the Kindergarten.
- Oh, yes! - But - No, a catch.
Fine.
What are your demands? You're gonna have to hold my hand the whole time.
[Chuckles.]
Well, here we are.
Okay, great.
Let's go.
[Both scream.]
[Thud.]
This place just gets worse every time I come here.
I know.
It's been so poorly managed.
It must have been in way better shape - when you first emerged.
- Emerged? Yeah, you're some kind of quartz, right? You must have been made
here.
Uh I came from my mom and dad.
Are those some kind of rocks? - Or another planet? - [Chuckles.]
Nope.
My dad's from Earth, but my mom's a Gem.
You're some sort of hybrid? How is that possible? The answer to that is a story
I like to call "The ballad of Rose and Greg.
" I don't care.
Let's just hurry to the control room.
You sure this is safe? The last time I was here, there were a bunch of fusion
monsters.
Yes, I was checking their progress.
- What's the deal with those things? - When it became clear that the Earth was
no longer a viable colony, Homeworld decided to use it for something else a
series of experiments.
A gem geo-weapon.
- Oh, did you help? - Negative.
I wasn't lucky enough to be around for that.
But I read over a few hundred years of reports.
[Chuckles.]
This is where you need to be, right? Yes.
I'm going to have to remove this panel and do a bit of work to restore power to
this room, so can I have my hand back now? Okay, but stay where I can see you.
[Panel beeps.]
[Grunts.]
[Straining.]
It's over.
I can't show you anything.
Let's go back.
- Mind if I try? - Go ahead.
Knock yourself out.
[Grunts.]
- Whoa! - There you go.
All right.
This over here it's not perfect, but it'll do for now.
- [Groans.]
Come on.
- What's up, Dot? I can't quite reach the .
- It's okay to ask for help, you know.
- I had it.
[Clears throat.]
These are the early attempts at artificial fusion.
That's a lot of gem shards.
We were growing them here at this very site.
But these were just prototypes for the final product, a singular giant
artificial fusion comprised of millions of gem shards the Cluster.
Peridot, you're saying there's a giant mutant gem the size of the Earth under
us right now? Oh, no.
When it forms it'll be much, much bigger than the Earth.
Right now it lies dormant, incubating in the Earth's core.
But when it emerges and takes its physical form, it will destroy the planet.
The prototypes are already emerging.
The Cluster is next.
If we can't get off this planet, we've got to stop the Cluster.
I thought it'd be impossible, but now we have a chance.
- What is it? - It's you, Steven! Now that you're filled in, we can get to
work.
Uh how am I supposed to help? Well, you have all the information we need about
Earth and its erratic behavior.
Put that together with my expansive knowledge of the Cluster, and we just might
be able to stop it.
No, Peridot, I don't think you get it.
Just because I know how clouds work, doesn't mean I know how to stop a giant
mutant in the center of the Earth.
Besides, the only reason I know anything about clouds and rain - is because my
dad told me.
- What are you talking about? I used to be really scared of thunderstorms, just
like you.
Then dad explained how rain and all that stuff works, then I wasn't scared of
rain anymore.
Well, I'm sure you have other knowledge about how this planet works.
Sure, but none of it's gonna help us.
If we want to stop this Cluster thing, - we'll need help from the Crystal Gems.
- I said I don't need them! Let's just warp me back to the bathroom, or
whatever you call it, and we'll take care of this.
If it looks really bad, then we can just ask this dad for help, right?
[Creature screeches.]
- Yipe! What was that? - Oh, no! Gem mutants! [Screeching.]
Yaah! Do something! - I am doing something.
- Something useful! Uh, let's run.
Over here.
No, the other way.
No, not there.
Both: Aah! Let's run into this corner.
Oh, no! We're cornered! Both: Aah! Aah! Can't you destroy it? No, this is all I
can do on my own.
Yaah That's it.
We are finished.
[Roars.]
Garnet: Hang on, Steven.
It's the gems! Peridot, there's no way we can stop this thing in the Earth on
our own.
We need the help of the Crystal Gems.
Steven, are you all right?! - Move aside, Steven.
- Peridot?! What are you two doing here?! Steven, I thought I told you to keep
an eye on her.
- I know, but - He did what he was told.
All right.
Listen up, you clo [Sighs.]
Crystal Gems.
I've made up my mind.
I have something to tell you about the Cluster.

Barn
****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e23 Episode Script ******
**** Back to the Barn ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "Back to the Barn" As it seems I have no other options, I have
conceded to reveal some important information to you Crystal Gems.
- This - Whoa! is the Earth.
At the very center of the planet's core lies the Cluster.
Rotate.
This is the Cluster a massive artificial fusion composed of millions of gem
shards.
It has laid dormant for thousands of years within this planet's crust.
When this gem activates and takes its form, the result will be catastrophic.
Now! - What is that?! - It's the Cluster.
It does not look like that.
But it is real, and it can activate at any moment! - What a Cluster.
- That abomination must be stopped.
But how? We'll need to build some sort of machine to take us to the center of
the Earth.
- It'll have to - Hey! I wasn't finished speaking.
What we need is to build some sort of machine to take us to the center of the
Earth.
It'll need to withstand up to 360 gigapascals of pressure and temperatures of
9,800 degrees.
Well, we mustn't waste time.
We need to start finding parts for this machine immediately.
Yes, obviously.
We'll start by dismantling all - devices inside this dwelling? - Wha? This
primitive radiation concentrator should come in handy! Nyah! This primitive
vibration transmitter could possibly serve a function.
There's a remote chance something useful could be inside this primitive image
cube.
Wait! I have a better idea that doesn't involve destroying the house.
Classic Steven.
All right.
What we have here in the barn should be adequate enough for us to get started.
First, I recommend we organize the component types and assemble a rough
blueprint based on what we have available.
Sorry, Steven.
It's a lovely drawing, but it won't look like this.
Hmm.
Good.
Yes, this is adequate.
- Thank you.
You can go now.
- Uh, what? Hmm? Um that will be all? How do you get her to leave? - Excuse me,
I am not leaving.
- Yeah, she's got to stay and help build the drill thing, right? No, no.
You're confused.
- A Pearl can't build a thing like this.
- Why not? Because Pearls aren't for this.
They're for standing around a-and looking nice a-and, uh, holding your stuff
for you, right? That's enough! If we're going to work together, - you're going
to have to listen to me.
- Listen to you? Did you teach her to talk like this? - What are you talking
about? - She's a Pearl.
She's a made-to-order servant just like the hundreds of other Pearls being
flaunted around back on homeworld.
Wait.
There's hundreds of Pearls? - Well, yes, bu - And she looks like a fancy one,
too.
- Ugh! - Hundreds of Pearls So, who do you belong to, anyway? - Nobody! - Then
what are you for? Well, you can belong to me for now.
Ha! A Peridot with a Pearl! What would they say back home? Now, listen here,
you tiny twerp.
In case you've forgotten, you're on our turf now, and I didn't fight a 1,000-
year war for this planet's independence - to take orders from the likes of you!
- Excuse me? I am natural technician and a certified kindergartner.
I was made for this.
You were made to take orders, not to give them! Whoa, whoa, hang on, guys! Now,
we can all agree that you're both good at building things, so, can't you just
try listening to each other? No! I'm as good at building things as you.
Better, even! Ha! Name one thing you could engineer better.
- Go on.
- Robots.
Hmm? You should build robots giant robots.
I see a race a giant robo-race.
With prizes giant robo-prizes.
You mean like a competition? Yeah, to see who's better at building stuff.
What are these "ro-butts" you speak of? They're like those funky marble guys
you were sending, only bigger and you can ride them.
Ha! Building one of these "ro-butts" will be easy! - Well, I can build one
faster! - That's what you think! Yo, Steven.
How are the wonder nerds doing? Wah! Wh-What's going on? Are they building the
drill? No, we're building robots now.
- What'd you say?! - I said - Giant robot! - Ha! Pathetic.
Now, behold my vision of ultimate power! - Hey! - Mine's taller.
I win.
Ladies and gentlegems, welcome to the first annual Robolympics! - Whoo! -
Popcorn! This competition will test our robo-engineers' skills of robo-
construction and robo-piloting.
Whoever wins will get to be in charge of building the Cluster drill machine
thing.
Let the games begin! Wah! Ugh.
Ohhh! - Huh? - Huh? Oh! Mm-hmm.
Hmm All right, guys.
This is the final event! - You got this, P! - Get it, girl! Ready! Set! Chuck!
Whoa.
You both get a point on that one.
Hmm.
Hmm Looks like our final score is a tie! Well, that settles it.
You both get to lead the project together! No! This isn't over! I demand we
have a tiebreaker! Ugh, let's just give it a rest.
That's it! We tied.
We are the same.
- Let's move on.
- No! You're a Pearl.
You are beneath me! I'll always be better than you, and nothing I've seen today
will ever change that! Well, have you ever seen a Pearl do this? Oof! So, you
wanna fight? Good.
We should have done this from the beginning! Stop! Giant robots shouldn't
fight! Fight, fight, fight, fight! - Pearl! - It's all right, guys.
I've got this.
- Be careful! - Kick her in the butt! This is pointless! There's no way you're
gonna beat me! You're an accessory, somebody's shiny toy! Where do you get off
acting like your own gem? You're just a Pearl! That's right! I am a Pearl!
Whoo-hoo! What you're saying may be true, but it doesn't matter.
I'm still gonna kick your butt! Who-oh-oh! Uh-oh.
Pearl! Victory is mine! Now I'm the one in change.
Praise me! Praise me! - Pearl, are you okay? - I'm all right.
Yeah, P! Oh, that was awesome.
- You were hard core! - Oh, really? - Oh, yeah.
- Hey! Why aren't you listening to me? I won! I'm the natural leader here.
- She's just a common Pearl! - You're wrong! If Pearls are really like you say
they are, then Pearl isn't common at all.
She trained herself to fight, she learned how to build things, and she works
hard every day to be greater than she already is! That's not common.
That's amazing! Come on.
Let's clean up this mess.
Pearl you should come wrestling with me.
- Uh, I don't know.
- B-B-But I won! - What about the rules? - Welcome to Earth.
I have to admit, it's remarkable that a Pearl such as yourself could become
such a knowledgeable technician.
Mm.
Why don't we get started? - You're holding it upside down.
- Yes.
Of course.
You know, those round appendages on your machine - could be useful for
something.
- They're called wheels.
Looks like we're well on our way to stopping the Cluster.
"You think you can stop me?" We're doomed!

**** Too Far ****
- Garnet: # We # - # are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! "Too Far" Log date 7-1-1-2.
It's the third rotation of the Earth since commencements of a [inhales
sharply.]
collaborative approach to stopping the Cluster.
[Chalk scratching.]
Pearl: I've finished drawing up the blueprints for the drill head.
Peridot, if you could come take a look at this Remind me again why I should
listen to you.
Oh, right.
[Tape rewinding.]
The Pearl here has exhibited an aptitude for engineering that I begrudgingly
respect, though that doesn't explain the spontaneous singing, crying, singing
while crying.
[Laughs.]
Why did you give her that? Well, we did destroy all her stuff.
I thought it might make her feel a little better.
[Tape rewinding.]
Clods! Muddy clods! Running out of ways to say clods.
All right.
I chased away those cows.
Let's get to work.
[Clears throat.]
Before we begin, would you mind unfusing? It's making me incredibly
uncomfortable.
What?! What'd I say?! - Do we really have to do that? - Her having free reign
of the place made me incredibly uncomfortable.
[Grunting.]
- Here you go, Pearl.
- Oh, good.
Hmm.
No.
No, no, no, no.
I said I needed tungsten tungsten.
- Uh, what does tungsten look like? - Tungsten.
Ah! Ugh.
Never mind.
I'll just do it.
Meh.
[Groaning.]
I just need some sort of leverage optimizer.
[Chuckling.]
Leverage optimizer? That's what I said.
Oh! Ha.
You mean you want a screwdriver? [Laughs.]
- Do you have one or not? - Uh, w-why don't you just use this one? - Because it
was outside my radius.
- [Chuckling.]
Hey.
- Hey, Peridot, what do you call this? - A scent sponge.
- Huh? - [Laughs.]
Okay, what's this? - Vision sphere.
- Peridot, that's Wait, wait, Steven.
Peridot, these? [Angrily.]
Touch stumps.
- This? - Gravity connectors.
- This?! - That's your butt! [Both laugh.]
Oh, man, Peridot, you're killing me! I am not! That would violate our truce
agreement.
[Laughing.]
No, no, no.
You're funny.
- Funny? - Peridot, if you can get the magnetron out of that microwave, we'll
have everything we need except for the drill head.
Why don't I just get an injector drill head - from the kindergarten? - Oh.
Well, I guess that's something you could try.
Garnet: She's not going to the kindergarten without a chaperone.
What? You've got to be joking.
You'll know when I'm joking.
[Mutters.]
Me and Steven can go with her.
- Eh? - Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her.
- Approved.
Keep her in line, Amethyst.
- You got it! [Groans.]
Log date 7-1-1-2.
The Amethyst and the Steven have volunteered to help me dismantle this era-
1 drill.
How stylistically displeasing.
The newer ones have a nicer finish.
- You making more nerd notes? - What is nerd? [Snickers.]
Can you use it in a sentence? [Clears throat.]
Nerd You are a nerd.
[Laughs.]
Amethyst, cut that out.
As you can see, this planet is annoying, and everything is annoying.
Amongst its transgressions is the need for the Amethyst to ask permission from
the permafusion.
"Permafusion?" Is that what you call Garnet? I could call her lots of things.
I could call her two things two clods! [Laughs.]
Walking around like she's one clod.
[Laughs wickedly.]
[Snickers.]
What's wrong with that? She's not even fighting! She's You know, she's just,
you know, like a You know! [Laughs.]
- You're a real gem, "Perry.
" - Yes.
I am.
A gem.
Okay, okay.
Do Steven next.
- What's weird about Steven? - Where do I even begin? He's some sort of hybrid
abomination.
I don't even understand how he functions.
His organic half consumes so much energy that he has to constantly feed, and he
spends so much time expelling that he has a whole room dedicated to it.
[Laughing.]
Uh, no, something else Talk about something else! [Continues laughing.]
[Snorting.]
[Laughs.]
The strangest thing is, Amethyst, you think you have to listen to them.
[Laughs.]
You're the one who should be in charge! Ha! That's your best joke yet.
No, really.
Pearl is a pearl.
Garnet is a fusion.
I don't even know what - he's supposed to be.
- Hey! You're the only Crystal Gem that's actually a gem.
[Laughs nervously.]
- Whaaa? - You outrank everyone on your team.
They should be listening to you.
You're a strong, singular, fully functional soldier, - despite the fact that
you're defective.
- Defective? Well, sure.
[Chuckles.]
You're small.
- So? - Well, you're not supposed to be.
Hold on.
Wait, wait.
Let me guess.
This This is the hole you came out of.
Too small, too low, the exit marks look about every other hole.
Hmm.
This place must've been empty when you came out.
No wonder you have no idea what you're supposed to look like! - Peridot.
- What was I supposed to look like? Well, you're a quartz.
They're huge, loyal soldiers.
You should be twice your size, broad-shouldered, intimidating, but you simply
stayed in the ground too long.
Are you saying I'm wrong? [Laughs.]
"Gemetically" speaking, yes.
When you think about it, it's all so [chortles.]
funny.
[Laughs wickedly.]
Amethyst.
Hey, soldier, maybe you can help me get this hunk of drill off.
See? Look at that! You can do everything a normal quartz can do.
Let's head back and shove this thing in Pearl's face.
- Amethyst, are you okay? - Don't worry about it.
Oh! It's lovely.
To think we'd be using the same technology that started all this to fix it this
drill is pure irony! Actually, it's mostly carbonite.
Would that make it "carbony"? [Groans.]
Oh, oh, oh! Amethyst! Check out this Hmm "Rhythmatic" pulverizer.
[Laughs.]
That's funny.
I'm so funny.
[Laughs.]
Whatever, dude.
That was the incorrect response.
Hey, Amethyst isn't laughing when I do these things.
Why isn't she laughing? - Peridot, you really hurt her feelings.
- What? You were pretty mean to her at the kindergarten.
Mean? No way.
I was being cool.
Amethyst loved it.
She's probably telling the Pearl how much fun she had now.
Amethyst, hi, hi! Hi, Amethyst! She She won't even look at me.
It's making me feel smaller.
You feel bad.
That's how you made her feel.
[Scoffs.]
Who cares about how she feels? Who cares about any of you?! You're all just
rocks, ruddy muddy clumps beneath my gravity connectors! [Roars.]
Ohh! [Sighs.]
Another one of her temper tantrums.
I'm surprised you two made it back from the kindergarten - without driving each
other crazy.
- Yeah.
[Bird cawing.]
[sighs.]
This little thing [Muttering angrily.]
Aah! - Ugh.
- How's everything going up there? I'm fine.
There's nothing wrong.
Everything's fine.
[Machinery beeps.]
- Aah! No, no, no, no! Stop! - Peridot? [Dramatic music plays.]
Oof! The panel.
- Whoa! - Wait! Oof! [Gasps.]
It's okay! I got i-i-i-t! [Screaming.]
- What the aah! - Amethyst! [Grunting.]
Aah! [Grunts.]
[Music ends.]
It's okay.
Everything's okay.
It was just a drill.
[Laughs weakly.]
[Coughs.]
- Uh Peridot? - Aah! It was an accident.
I swear! Hey, don't worry about it.
We know you didn't mean to start the drill.
Uh, yeah.
And that was an accident, too.
We leave for one second, and everything goes off the rails! - I blame the cows.
- No, it's fine.
It's fine.
We'll rebuild it stronger, better.
We'll add seatbelts! [Grunts.]
Ah! Hey, are you all right? That was a close one.
It's a good thing Peridot was there to save you.
[Metal clatters.]
Yes, it is a good thing.
- Listen.
I, um - Just spit it out.
Ugh! Why are you Earthlings so difficult?! Log date 7-1-1-2.
This entire planet is backwards.
There hasn't been one instance of correct behavior exhibited by any one of
these Crystal Gems.
I have concluded that they are all defective.
But I am no better.
I failed my mission, and now I'm working with the enemy, and I can't even get
that right.
I have apparently "hurt" Amethyst's "feelings," which was not my intent.
If I've damaged my standing with the best gem here, then I've made a serious
mistake.
I'm still learning.
I hope you understand.
I want to understand.
I'm sorry.
Peridot, facet 5.
End log.
- As you can see - Oh, Peridot! [Scoffs.]
Amethyst: Hey, uh, Peridot.
Thanks.
- But you're still a nerd.
- I'll be sure to add that to my notes.
- How do you feel? - Big.

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e25 Episode Script ******
**** The Answer ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "The Answer" Mm.
- Steven! - Garnet! Is it morning already? It's midnight.
Happy birthday, Steven.
Oh, man, are you finally gonna tell me that you're a fusion of the Gems Ruby
and Sapphire like you promised? You already know about all that, Steven.
It's true.
But what you don't know is how Ruby and Sapphire first met.
O-M-G! I don't! The Earth, 5,750 years ago.
It was a promising site of a new Gem colony, but progress was being thwarted by
a small persistent group of rebels.
A team of diplomatic Gems were sent from Homeworld to investigate.
Among those Gems was Sapphire, a rare aristocratic Homeworld Gem with the power
to see into the future.
Assigned to her were three Rubies - Hup! - Hup! - Hey! common soldiers with a
mission to protect her.
Hey, can't wait for those rebels to get here.
Yeah.
When I see those rebels, I'm gonna punch them right in their faces.
- What are you saying? - I'm gonna punch them all over their bodies, and then
it'll be over.
- What if I just punch you? - Ow! Oh, come on.
We'll punch them together when we fuse.
- That's why they sent, uh, three of us.
- Three this! Oh, I, um, I'm so sorry, I - Let me, uh - I'm fine.
- What? - It's okay.
It was bound to happen.
I oh.
Okay.
Now, please wait here.
I must attend to my duties.
- Right.
- Yes.
Sapphire had been called to Earth by Blue Diamond specifically to share her
vision of the future.
My Diamond, I've arrived.
Blue Diamond spoke.
"Sapphire, tell me what will happen here.
" I foresee the rebels attacking the cloud arena.
Before they are cornered, they will destroy the physical forms of seven Gems,
including two of my Ruby guards and myself.
Immediately after my form is destroyed, the rebels will be captured.
The rebellion ends here.
"Thank you, Sapphire," Blue Diamond said, relieved.
"That's all I needed to know.
" I look forward to speaking with you again once I reform back on Homeworld.
Sapphire knew she would be a casualty, but it did not faze her.
She saw her whole life laid out before her, and she had already accepted all of
it.
What a beautiful place to build a colony.
I wish I could have seen more of this planet.
Uh, there's still time.
That is a nice thought.
But, no.
Blue Diamond, leave this planet.
This colony will not be completed.
It's the rebels! Who are you? Show yourselves! We are the Crystal Gems.
The attack was right on schedule.
Hm? Hee-yah! - Hup! - Yeah! - Hup! Ha! Thank you, Ruby.
You did your best.
Ruby suddenly realized what Sapphire meant.
She had known that Ruby would fail.
Sapphire had accepted it, but Ruby Ruby could not.
No! What? What? What What is this? Wait.
This is Hm? - Let's go.
- Uh, bye.
Is this The furious crowd closed in around Ruby and Sapphire.
They had never seen fusion of two different types of Gems.
"Unbelievable.
" "Disgusting.
" "This is unheard of.
" Blue Diamond's voice cut through the crowd.
"The rebels have fled.
Sapphire, this is not the scenario you described.
" This is not what I saw.
I don't know what happened.
- I - No, it was me.
"Clearly," said Blue Diamond.
"How dare you fuse with a member of my court.
" Forgive me.
I "You will be broken for this.
" Wait! What are you doing?! Noooo! Why'd you do that? I have to get you back
up there! They were gonna break you.
Who cares? There's tons of me.
Uh! What do we do now?! Sapphire had known every moment of her life how it
would happen and when.
But because of Ruby's impulsive gesture, she suddenly jumped the track of fate.
And everything from that instant on was wrong and new.
She couldn't see.
She couldn't move.
She was frozen.
Ah! We have to get you out of here.
Come on.
All right, this should be good for now.
Thank you.
Wha? What kind of Ruby am I supposed to be? Look at this.
It's all my fault you're stranded here.
- How am I gonna save you? - You already did.
- What? - You already saved me.
I've seen Gems fuse before, but I had no idea that's what it felt like.
I always thought I never realized that fusion - that you disappear like that.
- It's never like that.
Whenever I fuse, it's always just been me, but bigger.
I-I've never had a third eye before.
I've never had more than one.
It was nice.
Yeah.
Ruby and Sapphire: # Where did we go? # what did we do? I think we made
something entirely new and it wasn't quite me and it wasn't quite you I think
it was someone entirely new oh um well, I just can't stop thinkin' so um did
you say I was different? And you hadn't before? Of course not When would I have
ever? I'm so sorry No, no, don't be And now you're here forever What about you?
What about me? Well, you're here, too We're here together I was back.
I was someone, and I didn't know who.
But felt like I was getting the hang of my strange, new form.
And then I fell.
Ah! Ow.
Ah! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt me? - It's you the fusion.
- We didn't mean to fuse.
Well, we did this time.
We'll unfuse.
We'll We'll No, no, please.
I'm glad to see you again.
And there they were Rose Quartz, the leader of the rebellion and her terrifying
renegade, Pearl.
- I don't upset you? - Who cares about how I feel? How you feel is bound to be
much more interesting.
How I feel? I-I feel lost and scared and and happy.
Why am I so sure that I'd rather be this than everything I was supposed to be?
And that I'd rather do this than everything I was supposed to do? Welcome to
Earth.
Can you tell me, how was Ruby able to alter fate? Why was Sapphire willing to
give up everything? - What am I? - No more questions.
Don't ever question this.
You already are the answer.
So, what was it? - The answer? - Love.
- Wow.
I knew it.
- So did I.

[pop!.]
[Goggles clink.]
We should celebrate our progress.
We should celebrate your progress.
- You've grown a lot this year.
- He certainly has.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so! [Horn honks.]
- Steven! - Connie! - Happy birthday! - Thanks! Welcome to the party.
May I offer you a refreshment? Oh, Steven, how gentile.
Together: Clink! So, this is the barn.
I'm surprised your parents are letting you stay for the weekend.
[Chuckles.]
It wasn't easy.
They only let me come after equipping me with every piece of safety gear on the
planet.
What should I do with this defibrillator? Um, we can just leave it in the car
for now.
[Giggles.]
Well, I'm glad you could make it.
- Me too.
- All right, move it, Connie! I was his best friend first.
Happy birthday! Okay, shtuball.
- Let me get a look at you.
- Dad! Sorry, I just can't believe my little boy's growing up so quickly.
Seems like just yesterday you were a baby, and now you're turning - Steven,
you're 14?! - Yeah? But I'm only 12 3/4! You're older than me? - I-I don't
believe it! - Well, sure.
Check it out.
Let's see we have infant, baby.
Toddler what's it called adolescent.
Adolescent, adolescent, adolescent.
Whoa, looks like you stagnated there a little bit, buddy.
Mr.
Universe, could I show you how the defibrillator works? Oh, uh, sure.
Be right back, kiddo.
- So, he's not going to grow up? - Well, it's hard to say.
He's a Gem, and Gems don't really grow up.
I mean, I've known the Gems since I was 22, and they never change.
They just are what they are.
But Steven's not like the other Gems he's half human.
So I'm not really sure how he's gonna age.
- We're just gonna have to wait and see.
- Yes, right.
- Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah.
- Human beings? - Human beings.
[Grunts.]
Hey, birthday man, whatcha doin'? I want to hang up this banner, so Dude, it'd
be easier if you just stretch on up here.
Ha! How's that? - Oh, yeah.
- Come on, what's the verdict? I can't hold this forever.
- Uh, looks great.
- There's my B-day guy! - Uh, what's up, Dad? - We're almost ready to start.
Got your birthday cape and crown ready, too.
Here, put 'em on and go wait in the barn.
[Chuckles.]
Okay, now sit tight.
You're gonna love this.
[music.]
Dad: Okay, Steven, open up! Together: Surpri [All gasp.]
- Wow.
- Oh, my.
Huh? Hm, hm, hm.
Steven, are you feeling okay? Huh.
You look good, Steven.
[Deep voice.]
Oh [chuckles.]
thanks, Garnet.
- Dude, your neck! - Oh, uh, what about it? You have one! So you just grew all
of a sudden? I had a magical growth spurt just now.
- Cool, right? - Oh, right.
It's totally cool! All right, then.
Let's get this party started.
[Blows.]
Yeah! Let's eat this cookie cake! - Here, Steven.
- Wow, thanks.
Oh, you don't have to untie that.
It's just a box made to look like I spent a lot of time wrapping it.
[Laughs.]
Ohhh, a new shirt! - What a pretty color.
- Try it on.
[Grunting.]
Oh, I guess it doesn't fit since No, don't worry it fits fine just like this.
[Laughs.]
[Grunts.]
Here it comes! I got it, Pearl! [Grunts.]
- Pearl: Nice, Connie.
- Ye-ah! If you hit it, you get it.
No worries.
I'll grab it! - Hm - Connie, let me.
Hm! - Oh, cool.
Thanks, Steven.
- Hm! No problem, Connie.
Amethyst: Yo, bring back that shuttlecock! Huh? [Groaning.]
[Gasps.]
Oh, no! [Grunting.]
[Breathing heavily.]
Whew! [Upbeat music plays.]
Ugh! This one goes out to the birthday boy, and his best friend.
[Slow music plays.]
[Both giggle.]
I still can't believe all this time you were older than me.
You should sneak me into a PG-13 movie sometime.
Oh, yeah.
Heh heh, heh [Chuckles.]
No, I'm just kidding.
I would never ask you to break the law.
It's funny that I have to look up at you now, though.
- Funny good or f-funny bad? - Funny good.
- Aw, Steven's having fun.
- We know how to throw a party.
[Clears throat.]
Excuse me for a moment, Connie.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Be right back.
[Panting.]
[Warbling.]
[Normal voice.]
Oh, geez! If I can just keep this up for the rest of my life, no one will
suspect a th [Pi?ata creaking.]
- What are you doing? - Wha Wha well, what are - [Deep voice.]
you doing? - What are you doing to your body? Whoa, whoa, whoa, have you been
stretching - yourself out all day?! - No, I was just slouching.
Why are you doing this? It really isn't like you.
Because, Dad, I can't stay a kid forever.
When Connie grows up and becomes president, what is that gonna make me, first
boy?! Steven, you can't just keep stretching forever.
If you hold it too long, you could really hurt yourself.
Yeah, well, I'm half human, so maybe it works different for me.
- We'll just have to wait and see, right? - [Sighs.]
Steven That one's canis helicopterus.
- [Stifled.]
Uh, uh, helicopterus? - Yeah, Dogcopter! Get it? - Now you make one up.
- Mm okay, um [clears throat.]
That one's, uh snake constellation.
That's pretty good.
Are you okay? It looks like you're gonna throw up.
- Oh, yeah.
E-Everything's fine.
- Okay, that's good.
You know, to be honest, I-I was a little worried before.
This might sound silly, but I'm really glad that I'm going to get to grow up
with you.
[Warbling.]
Steven? Steven, what's going on?! What happened? [Baby voice.]
What? Uh [Crying.]
We were just talking, then all of a sudden He turned back into a baby?! - Yes!
- Dude, I told you! Stretching your body out for that long is not good for you.
[Babbling.]
- Here you go, Pearl.
- Oh, no, no, don't give him to me.
- Hand him over, Amethyst.
- [Steven crying.]
Here you go.
Meh, meh, meh, blah! Uh [Crying.]
My power means nothing to an infant.
Okay, this is my department.
- What are you gonna do? - Don't worry, I got this.
[Crying.]
[maraca shaking.]
How can the Gems not know what to do? You think they knew the first thing about
raising a baby? That was all me, but I don't get it.
Driving always used to calm him down.
- But how do we change him back?! - I don't know.
Look, Connie, let me take you home.
I-I'll call you when this all gets sorted out.
[Babbling.]
W-Wait, no.
I want to stay.
- Are you sure? - Yeah.
I just want to be there for Steven.
Don't worry, Steven.
It doesn't matter to me what age it seems like you are.
I want to hang out with you no matter what.
Your dad still has to run his car wash, and the Gems have to do gem stuff, so
I'll watch you when they're not around.
I can come see you after I'm done training with Pearl, too! Doesn't that sound
fun? [Babbles.]
Greg: Look at that he finally stopped crying.
Well, that's a start.
- Ahem! - What's up, Amethyst? Baby Steven needs changing.
Oh, my gosh.
Ohhh, my gosh! Did he get even smaller? Steven's microscopic! He's reverted
back to a zygote! Everyone, Steven is [Normal voice.]
Look, it fits now.
You're back to normal! Sorry this was a disaster.
I wanted to look older for you.
- That doesn't matter.
- I heard what you said in the van.
It's really okay if I don't age like a human? Of course it is! I like you just
the way you are.
[Muffled.]
Oh, okay! Uh, Steven, you've got something on your cheek.
Huh? [Gasps.]
It's a facial hair! - Really? - Dad! - What is it, little man? - Look at this!
Holy smokes, you're growing a beard! You really are getting older! - Everybody,
look at this! - Unbelievable.
- Very impressive.
- Is there more where that came from? [Laughter.]
[giggles.]

****** Steven Universe (2013) s02e27 Episode Script ******
**** It Could've Been Great ****
- # We # - # are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # - # believe in # - # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl #
And Steven! "It Could've Been Great" - Steven.
- Hi.
Why did we stop working on the drill? Why are they just sitting there, looking
at nothing?! We worked hard, and we deserve to take it easy for a little bit.
I mean, just look at that view! It's beautiful! It's going to be blown to
oblivion by the Cluster if we don't get back to work! Working hard is
important, but feeling good is important, too! What are you talking about?! Hey
bzzzz! What is that, a a "C"? - The drill? - Yeah! Oh, my gosh! Now it's music!
- Music? - Yeah, it's music.
Like this do re mi fa so la ti do Do mi so do.
isn't it pretty? That's exceedingly simple.
Do mi so ti.
we're making music What is the point? You're not making anything.
Well, if it isn't anything, then why does it sound so good? I suppose it's just
interest.
Do mi so do devoid of substance or purpose.
A hypothetical pattern.
Do mi so ti for the satisfaction of bringing it to completion! - Sure! - Do mi
so ti interest without meaning.
- Solutions without problems? - And then you just add words.
Here's one I've been working on Life and death and love and birth and peace and
war on the planet Earth is there anything that's worth more than peace and love
on the planet Earth? - # oh, whoa, come on and sing it with me # - Sing? - #
the words relate to the key # - Key? if it's a pattern, if it's a pattern then
just repeat after me life and death and love and birth life and death and love
and birth Now you sing # mi, fa mi, mi fa mi ti la # and peace and war on the
planet Earth - Yes, yes, that's it! - That's so easy.
Yeah, but that's what's fun about it.
You should write something.
You should write a song! - About what? - Whatever you're thinking.
I guess we're already here I guess we already know we've all got something to
fear we've all got nowhere to go I think you're all insane but I guess I am,
too anybody would be if they were stuck on Earth with you Yes! life and death
and love and birth and life and death and love and birth and life and death and
love and birth and peace and war on the planet Earth is there anything that's
worth more is there anything that's worth more is there anything that's worth
more than peace and love on the planet Earth? Whoa! - Nice work.
- Ah! - We really did it, huh? - We? Oh, wait.
I need to check something! She's come so far! It feels like yesterday she was
trying to kill us.
- No, no, that was several weeks ago.
- Coordinates! We still need the Cluster's exact coordinates in order to drill!
There's a Diamond base that may hold that information, - but getting there is
going to be difficult.
- How come? Because it's not accessible by warp pad, and it's on The Moon?!
Yeah, Steven, the Moon.
Lion, can you make us a special super warp to the Moon? Come on, lion! We got
to do this to stop the Cluster! If we don't, there's gonna be no more Earth! No
more fun times with your pals! No more lion lickers? No more naps? Guess it was
"naps.
" Pretty cool, right?! Go, lion, go! Lion! Are you okay, bud? Get me out of
this furry freak ugh! Ow! Aw, lion, you've earned your naps for the week! We
made it.
It doesn't look like the Moon.
Hey, look over here.
I think it's a door! Uh Yep! We on the Moon! Amethyst, please don't blow us
into space! Whoa! Look at me! I'm a moon boy! Ha ha! All right, moon boy! Moon
boy, quadruple backflip! - Hey! Why can't I be a moon boy? - We're Gems.
We're a space-faring race designed to conquer other worlds! Our physical forms
adjust automatically - to the gravity of any planetoid! - Aw, lame! I was
bouncing on the Moon one day Huh? Hey, Peridot, who is this supposed to be?
It's Blue Diamond! Wait.
Are they all here? Ah, yes! - There she is! - Who? Behold, Yellow Diamond!
Isn't she magnificent? Wow! So, who are the Diamonds anyway? - They seem like a
big deal! - Are you joking me? The Diamonds are the gem matriarchs! Together
they make up the great Diamond authority that governs Homeworld and all the
outlying colonies! We live to serve them! I I mean, we were all made to serve
them even though some of us don't anymore.
Hey, I think that's a control surface over there! - Let's take a look! - Yeah!
I think this is right.
The material is different from the surrounding stone.
- I think if I just do this! - Huh? This is so incredible! Only the most elite
of the elite can enter these sanctums.
We are literally walking in the footsteps of the Diamonds.
They must really like stairs.
- Hey, what's this room? - It's not what we came for.
Can we hurry it up? This place gives me the creeps.
We really are on the Moon! Oh, my goodness! This looks like it could be brand-
new! I mean, it's a relic by today's standards, but, golly, it's so elegant, so
simple, so perfect! - So, how do you turn it on? - I have no idea.
Wah! Hey, it's got one of those glowy hand dealies! - You can't sit there! -
Why not? It's really cool! That chair is only for the most elite Gems! You
can't go around sitting where an elite would sit! Well, they aren't here now,
right? - Hey, what's this doodad for? - Put that back! Hmm, okay, let's see
here.
There we go.
This is a really old system.
Gotta find the right file Aha! Cluster, Cluster, where are you, Cluster? Aha!
There's the insertion point! Looks like the beta kindergarten in facet nine.
It's the smaller of the two, not nearly as impressive as yours, Amethyst! - Uh,
thanks? - But where is the Cluster now? Hang on.
There it is! It's embedded deep in the mantle.
Relative to the barn, it's roughly 2,500 units down.
All we need to do is feed this data to the drill, and we should be all set!
That's it, then! Mission accomplished! - Yeah, team! - Great.
Let's get the heck out of here! Wait.
Hold on! Does this thing have any games on it? No, no, no, no.
This wasn't used for games.
Aw.
It was used for planning the colony.
Here, look! So here's a map of all structures that were originally built on
Earth.
All told, this probably only accounts for maybe 5% of what was originally
planned! - What was the plan? - Well, let's take a look.
Ta-da! A finished Earth colony! Wow! Look at this! 89 kindergartens, 67 spires,
a galaxy warp in each facet, efficient use of all available materials.
What were you thinking shutting this operation down! - It could have been
great! - No, you're wrong! What do you mean? It's perfect.
Look at it! - We are looking at it.
- Yeah, this plan stinks! Completing this colony would have meant the
extinction of all life on Earth.
But think of the good it would have done the Gems would that would have been
made, - our empire expanded! - Rose Quartz believed all life was precious and
worth protecting! Well, if she wanted to protect it, she did a lousy job!
There'd be no Cluster if the Earth had stayed a colony! Now there's no colony,
and there's gonna be no Earth! So thank you, Rose Quartz you doomed the planet!
Oh! is there anything that's worth more than You listen to me now.
You are talking about things that you do not understand.
Garnet, stop, please! It's not worth it.
We're done here.
Let's just go home.
What'd I say?! I'm just stating a fact! The rebellion didn't really save Earth.
It just delayed the inevitable.
That's not the way they see it.
They've spent thousands of years trying to protect the Earth.
I thought maybe you finally understood why.
- Peridot! - What? I'm coming.
Let's go, you two.

**** Message Received ****
- Garnet: # We # - # are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! "Message Received" How much
longer till we can use the drill? Well, with the new coordinates we got from
the moonbase, We should be ready to go.
But we really should perform a few tests first.
- Oh! Steven.
- Peridot.
- I need to talk to you.
- Uh, yeah.
Sure.
Why are we in this broken-down vehicle? I wanted to ask you about the Diamonds?
Oh! I don't know what the others have told you, But there's a reason they're in
charge.
- Why's that? - They're objectively better than us.
Every Gem has their strengths and weaknesses but not them.
They're absolutely, totally, completely flawless beings! Especially my Diamond
Yellow Diamond.
The most perfect, the most reasonable, rational, efficient decider ever to
exist in the universe.
- You're really loyal to her, aren't you? - How could I not be? We might have
our little truce, but I'll never forsake the Gem I was made for.
That's good, because she's right behind you.
What? [Gasps.]
- Aah, no! Aah! - Save your strength! You're up against one of the earth's
greatest trapping technologies the child safety lock! [Gasps.]
No! No! How could you do this to me the great and lovable Peridot?! I thought
we were finally friends, like you wanted! I saw you sneak this off the moon
base while no one else was looking! - What is it? Tell me! - It's nothing
special and definitely not important at all! Hmm.
Then why don't I just smash it?! No, no, no, no, wait! All right, look.
I have a plan.
Allow me to explain.
It's a communicator.
Meant for the express purpose of contacting the Diamonds back on Homeworld.
You're still trying to contact Homeworld? Yes.
Of course! I figured it out! You simple clods keep trying to protect the Earth,
but you can't do anything right! I let myself get carried away, too laughing,
singing, building our little machine! But don't you see? None of that matters!
All that matters is that I'm of use to Yellow Diamond! This planet can be of
use to Yellow Diamond! I must contact her to reveal what I've discovered! But
the Diamonds are bad! They don't care about the Earth.
They wanted to hollow it out, and now they want to blow it up with the Cluster!
Yes, yes! That's the point! Ugh! Why do I keep sticking my neck out for you!
You're never gonna be on our side! - Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl! - Steven, no
don't get them! Steven! Release me! [All gasp.]
She took a direct line to the Diamonds from the moon base?! What was she
thinking?! Man, after everything we've gone through, she's still out to get us.
Oh, I'm taking back all my cool nicknames for her.
So long "Perry" and "P-dot.
" Hello, P Aah! I'm too mad! I'll think of something later! [Horn honking.]
[Steven sighs.]
I see she knows what a horn is now.
You offered her a lot of your trust.
I did! And it blew up in my face.
You guys have been protecting the Earth for thousands of years! She could have
destroyed all of that the whole Earth! Why did I think I could change her mind?
Ugh.
I know, right? But I guess you can't, like, get into other people's heads and
change what they think.
Oh, maybe we can? Yeah! If we just shrink down really little, - we can get in -
No, no, no! I don't want to tell her what to do.
She should just know, shouldn't she? It's good you believe in everyone, Steven.
Like your mother, you seem to have a little more patience than the rest of us.
But the truth is not everyone deserves that patience.
Look on the bright side at least you got this thing away from her before she
did any real damage.
Yeah.
[Explosion.]
[Gasps.]
Oh, no! [Laughing.]
Free, free! [Laughing.]
How did she escape?! - Oh! - Fools! Your invisible rotary shield was no match
for me once I applied logic! [Growls.]
Now I'm gonna do this right! - Ugh! - See? None of you know what you're doing!
Oh-ho ho-kay! I been ready for this! - Get in.
- Where's Steven? Stupid Peridot! Stupid giant robot! Oh, why, oh, why did I
have to encourage her? There's no time for feeling horrible.
We have to catch Peridot before she contacts Yellow Diamond! That's right.
You can feel horrible all you want back at the temple.
[Screaming.]
[grunting.]
What's up, Peri-snot? Good one, Amethyst! [Groans.]
[Gasps.]
Huh! Dog pile! No, no! [Grunting.]
You're not getting away with it! I trusted you! I spent all that time bonding
and hoping and caring about you! You don't get it, either! This is your whole
[Straining.]
problem! Your emotions rule out reason! I will do what has to be done! [Diamond
activates.]
Huh? [Peridot laughing.]
She'll sort this out.
[All gasping.]
[Laughing.]
This is the Yellow Diamond control room.
- Is that another Pearl? - Who is she? Not all Pearls know each other, Steven.
Who authorized you to make this call? No one.
B-But it's an emergency! That's no excuse to use the direct Diamond
communication channel! - Yellow Diamond: Pearl? - Yes, my Diamond? Why is there
someone on the diamond line? I don't know! I was just about to tell her that
I'll take it from here.
[All gasp.]
Is that - Yellow - Diamond.
My Diamond! Peridot reporting in! Which Peridot? F-Facet 2F5L, cut 5XG.
I'm sorry to contact you this way, but all other forms of communication have
been destroyed and This says you're behind schedule on your mission to How is
the Earth? It's full of life! Organic life.
And where is the Jasper I assigned you? And why aren't you calling from the
ship? Oh, hmm the ship was destroyed.
By whom? It It It was destroyed by no one! There was an accident while we were
landing.
I'll inform your manager of your incompetence.
And what is the status of the Cluster? The Cluster will emerge shortly! Good.
We'll finally get some use out of that miserable planet.
Thank you for your report, Peridot.
There'll be a ship heading to your location to take you to your next
assignment.
Wait! I I wouldn't have called - just to waste your time with a report! - You
already have.
No, I mean, the reason I've called, the real reason is I believe we should
terminate the Cluster! Why? The organic ecosystem creates resources unique to
this world.
We can't sacrifice all that potential just for one geo-weapon! I'd like to tell
you some plans I came up with to utilize the planet without disrupting the
local I've heard enough.
I don't care about potential and resources.
What? I want my Cluster, and I want that planet to die.
Just make that happen.
No! - Huh?! - Are you questioning my authority? I'm questioning your
objectivity, my Diamond.
- Well! - You are out of line.
- I just think - I'm not interested - in the puny thoughts of a Peridot.
- But You have disrespected this channel and my time with your presence, - and
you would do well to - But Shut your mouth! You have failed at every stage of
this mission.
Your only chance to redeem yourself is to obey this simple order you are to
leave the Cluster to grow! It will tear apart the Earth, and I will take
immense satisfaction in erasing that hideous rock off of our star maps! Is that
clear?! I won't do it! I can tell you with certainty that there are things on
this planet worth protecting! What do you know about the Earth?! Apparently
more than you, you clod! Hmm?! Uh, Peridot, out! [Cheering.]
That was amazing! I can't believe I just did that.
I was so wrong about being so wrong about you! I can't believe I just did that.
You thought you could change her mind.
Yellow D got torn down by the Peridactyl! Ugh! Can one of you take this? - Why?
- Because it can be remotely detonated.
[Gasps.]
How do we stop it? Just get rid of it! - Uh, here, Amethyst! - What am I
supposed to do with it?! [Gasps.]
[Explosion.]
I thought I could reason with her.
Yeah, you really made her mad.
And then you insulted her to her face.
- Do you know what this means? - I'm a traitor to my Homeworld.
You're a Crystal Gem! Mmm! - Whether you like it or not.
- Oh! [Groaning.]

I disobeyed my orders and went against Yellow Diamond's wishes.
I'm a traitorous clod! I never want to think about what I've done again! I'm a
traitorous clod! I never want to think about what I've done again! And I called
Yellow Diamond a clod right to her face! I called Yellow Diamond a clod right
to her face.
Uh, Peridot, are you gonna be okay? I'm a traitorous clod.
Traitorous clod.
No.
It's all gonna work out.
You're with us now! You don't understand.
I'm protecting a planet I was once trying to destroy.
I used to follow every order every rule.
Now I'm a traitor.
A rebel! A Crystal Gem-m-m-m-m.
Clod! Clod! Clod! Well, that tape recorder seems to be helping.
No, it's not! It's a chronicle of my descent into madness! - You dropped this.
- Get it away from me.
Give it to Steven.
Return madness to its source! Are you sure you don't want it? Whatever.
It's yours now.
Yours.
Not mine.
Not mine.
Yours.
Yours.
- Let's calm down.
- Okay.
So, am I gonna have to wear a star? Where am I gonna put the star? They seem to
be getting along well.
I wonder when that happened.
Log date 7-1-1-2.
The Steven has given me this earth machine to replace my communicator log.
It looks extremely primitive.
He also said he wanted me to stop calling him "the Steven.
" It's just "Steven.
" I said I'd call him whatever I want! He told me that was rude.
Rude.
I guess I'll call him "Steven.
" The organic life forms of Earth have fascinating traits despite their poor
choice of residence.
I wonder if all of them have flight capabilities? Oh, you must be Peridot.
Whoa!! - Peridot! - What do you want? You can't just shove someone off of a
roof! - Why not? - This is a human! He isn't like us! He's fragile and soft!
Hey, it's not like a six pack is gonna save you - from that height.
- You could have seriously hurt him.
Well, how was I supposed to know that? Hm.
Greg, you'll have to excuse Peridot.
She's far from her homeworld, and she still has a lot to learn about our
planet.
- No, I don't! - Yes, you do! Uh, hey, yeah.
Don't worry about it! Ugh! In conclusion, not all of the organic beings here
can fly.
Additionally, it is, without question, that the permafusion, Garnet, is the
worst.
Today, I was assigned a "chore" cleaning duty like I'm the Pearl.
These clumps don't know how lucky they are to have me.
Although, while doing "chore", I did happen upon a container containing many
shirts.
Imagine appearance modifiers that aren't melded to your body.
- Oooh! - Nice shorts.
How How did these get here?! Log date 7-1-2-2.
Today marks the 30th earth rotation since my capture.
Happy one month can-aversary! - Cylinders? - They're stilts.
You tie them on your feet, and they make you taller.
I tried to spruce them up a bit.
I don't know what it is about flames, but they just make everything cooler.
Why are you giving me these? Because I want you to feel nice.
That's what gifts are for.
You give them to your friends to show you care.
And they go, "wow, thanks!" As if I'd stoop so low as to tie your earth trash
to my body.
Leave me! Go, go, go, go Go! And, wow, thanks! Why, yes, Pearl, I did get
taller.
How correct of you to notice.
Of course, Amethyst, I will acquire those cheesy chaps for you off that very
high shelf.
Hyah! Whoa.
They even function in reverse! Ugh! "Jokes.
" "Why did the chicken cross the road?" "The chicken wanted to get to the other
side of the road.
" What's a chicken? It seems the earth ones are constantly filling the voids of
their life with meaningless distractions.
On the last episode of "Camp pining hearts" I don't care that you're on the
yellow team, Percy.
We can make this work! It's coolor war, Paulette.
Doesn't that mean anything to you? What is this strange ritual? - Uh, that's
umm - Are they attempting fusion? No, well, my dad told me during certain
stages in your life How could anyone indulge in this baseless drivel?! I'll
have no part of it! Hour 78 of "Camp pining hearts".
It's the coolor war, Paulette.
Doesn't that mean anything to you? Uh, you've been here for a few days.
Is everything okay? I've just been watching your previously recorded
entertainment.
Is that the same episode from three days ago? - There's more than one? - Mmm
nah.
Oh.
You made a picture.
Picture? This isn't just a picture, Steven! It's a complex chart cataloging the
compatible characteristics between campers.
Somehow the rejects at camp clod fail to recognize the superior pair that is
Pierre and Percy.
- Well, that's 'cause Paulette likes Percy.
- Paulette.
Ha! Paulette has no place in the camp's hierarchy.
Now Pierre Pierre is a brute! Pierre laid waste to the three-legged races.
Pierre and Percy present the strongest battle formation.
They'd destroy the camp! - You got all this from one episode? - It's subtext,
Steven.
Allow me to explain.
Well, first of all, - I remember this part.
- Percy & Pierre are both on the yellow team And that's why Percy and Pierre
are objectively the best for each other! Gah! Log date 7-1-3-2.
Progress on the Cluster drill is going optimal, surprisingly.
Though I have a few complaints on the work ethic of Hey! Amethyst, really.
This is no time to be fooling around.
Aw, come on, P.
I'm just trying to lion the mood.
"Lion the mood.
" Do you always use shape-shifting like this? You mean to be really cool? -
Pretty much.
- But it's such a Significant use of energy compared to the output.
- What was that? - I've been practicing my "Perry-phrasing.
" Pretty impressive in my opinion, but it's hard to beat the original.
So, can you shift into anything? Sure.
Got a request? Bok bok! I'm a chicken! I get the joke now! Ha! Yes, well, at
least she isn't "lion around" anymore.
Pearl really tries for some reason, and I can appreciate that.
Amethyst's company is entertaining, as well.
But, the fused one eludes me.
Okay, we can add more support as we go, but for now, we just have to pick it up
and put it on top.
No sweat.
- Let's do this! - You've got the right idea, but we might want to be a bit
more careful.
Gotcha.
Shall we? Huh? That looks great.
Let's take a break.
What? - All right, I'm at my limit! - Evening, Peridot.
Explain it to me, fusion.
I can at least make sense of your existence if it's for a functional purpose.
But you? You're not using your combined size and strength - to do anything! -
I'm doing something.
- And what's that? - Stargazing.
Ich.
You can do that alone.
- Don't want to.
- Hm.
You can see Homeworld's galaxy from here.
You're right.
We're very different.
I appreciate that.
Really? If you really want to understand fusion, I can help you.
- What do you mean? - Let's fuse.
Oh, my stars! I get it, you're not ready.
That's fair.
- Another time then.
- No! No-No-No.
Just just gimme a sec! Yeah.
Get ready.
No, no, no, no, no! - I can't do it.
- That's fine.
- Peridot, I'm proud of you.
- Why?! Because you've made an effort to understand me.
But I still don't understand you! Why are you fused all the time? - I'm Percy
and Pierre.
- Oh! Okay, go.
Log date 7-14-2 No, you say it "7, 1, 4, 2".
Ugh, log date 7, 1, 4, 2.
I have attempted a fusion with the fusion Garnet.
I had hoped to gain a better understanding of fusion.
Instead I gained a better understanding of Garnet.
Wait, keep it on a moment.
Steven, you probably shouldn't have listened to Peridot's logs, but I know your
curiosity comes from a place of caring.
You should give the recorder back to her now.
- She's going to want to keep it.
- Wait, what? - Here, Peridot, take this back.
- Wow.
Thanks.

**** Super Watermelon Island ****
- Garnet: We - Are the Crystal - Steven: Gems - we'll always save the day
Steven: and if you think we can't All: we'll always find a way - that's why the
people - of this world - Garnet: believe in - Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl And
Steven! [Birds tweeting.]
[Creatures calling.]
[Creatures calling in distance.]
[Birds tweeting.]
Bah! [Gasp.]
[Growling.]
[Rumbling.]
[Barking, panting.]
[Barking.]
[Panting.]
[Barking.]
[Panting.]
[Barking.]
[Panting.]
[Music.]
Oh.
[Barking.]
[Laughter.]
[Rumbling.]
Huh? [Cawing.]
[Gong sounds.]
[Rattling.]
Huh? [Rumbling.]
[Suspenseful music plays.]
Aaaaaaah! [Roars.]
Aaah! Steven.
[Growl.]
[Gasping.]
- Didn't you feel that? - Feel what? The ground shook! This could be the start
of the emergence of the Cluster.
Stage 1: Slight tremors every quarter hour.
Stage 2: Full-scale Earthquakes.
Stage 3: The Earth is destroyed! We're running out of time.
- We need to drill right now! - No, it's Malachite! [all.]
Malachite? - What? - I was on mask island.
I was in a watermelon Steven.
They have a lovely community, but Malachite, she was there.
[Cough.]
Lapis Lazuli is losing control.
Soon, Jasper will overpower her and Malachite will be loose.
Who knows what sort of destruction an unstable fusion like Malachite could
cause? All right, Gems, Pearl, Amethyst, and I will walk to mask island.
Steven, it's too dangerous for you.
Stay here and watch after the drill with Peridot.
Let's go, Gems.
To the nearest warp pad.
[both.]
To the nearest warp pad! [Panting.]
[Rumbling.]
Whoa.
Peridot: So, Lazuli has Jasper trapped in a fusion? - You're joking me.
- It's true! But Lapis must be getting tired from fighting Jasper for so long.
Just being on a ship with Jasper made me tired.
Whoa.
Oh! Aah! I gotta help them! But they told me it was too dangerous.
Why don't you just disobey them? Rebel.
- Isn't that like your guys' thing? - Huh, you're right! Ooh, I know! I'll fall
asleep and go into a Watermelon Steven again.
This way, I can help them and be safe, at the same time.
[Malevolent chuckle.]
Wow.
You're a real anarchist.
[Sleepily.]
No one can tell me what to do.
[Snoring.]
Wait! What do I do now? Don't just leave me here! [Sigh.]
[Plays drums.]
[Chimes.]
[Rumbling.]
[Resonating.]
[Grunting.]
All right, let's put an end to this.
[Grunt.]
[Music.]
Give up! [Growl.]
[Panting.]
I'm impressed.
You really held out.
Malachi-i-te! [Gasp.]
They're here.
[Growl.]
Stop! Pathetic.
Don't you see? We've been holding us back for too long.
And for what? If we're going to be this thing together, why don't we have some
fun? We don't have to fight.
You're outnumbered.
I may be outnumbered, but you're out of your depth.
I can't wait to tear you Gems apart.
[Roar.]
[Music.]
[Slice.]
[Roar.]
[Grumble.]
[Panting.]
[Groaning.]

[Wailing.]
[Barking.]

Raw-aw-aw-r! [Chanting continues.]
Rawr! You know, you're right.
There really is something more to this fusion thing.
- It's not just a cheap thrill.
- Aaaah! You've really shown me a whole new world of possibilities.
Keep it together.
[Grunt.]
Allow me to thank you.
Oh! Sorry, but there's only room for one abomination on this measly planet.
Rawwwwr! [Laughter.]
[Trumpet blows.]
[Gasp.]
Huh? Raaaaaah! [Trumpet blows.]
[Laughter.]
[Trumpet blows.]
Oh! Aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa- aa-aa-aa-ah! Huh? Unh! Unh! [Gasping.]
[Growling.]
[Straining.]
Argh! [Panting.]
[Roar.]
What is this?! You think you can hold me down?! Nobody can.
- Aah! - Ah! Not anymore.
[Grunt.]
Hey! Don't forget about me.
Agh! Ooh! Arr-arr! [Grumble.]
[Gasp.]
You two should spend some time apart.
[Music.]
[Cheering.]
[Cheering.]
[Whooping.]
Agh! [Resonating.]
[Panting.]
[Chuckle.]
Urr.
I'm alive.
Steven? Is that you in there? Thank you.
We couldn't have done it without your help.
Good job, melonhead.
Thank you, all of you.
You are truly brave.
Awww! [Laughter.]
[Rumbling.]
Aw.
[Cawing.]
Uh-oh! [Barking.]
It must be the Cluster.
Peridot was right.
Steven, it's up to you.
The world was destroyed.
We won't make it back in time.
Wake up.
Get Peridot and start drilling.
The Earth needs you, Steven.
We'll be fine.
You can do this.
We believe in you.
You got this, dude! You know the drill.
[Pearl.]
Be careful, Steven.
Watch each other's backs.
[Garnet.]
And, Steven we love you.
[Chirping.]
And, Steven, we love you.
[Rumbling.]
[Whimpering.]
[Grunts.]
[Gasps.]
If you're done just lying there, maybe it's about time that we stop the world
from ending! - Where are the others?! - They're stuck on mask island! - We have
to drill without them! - Ugh! Am I the only one who understands the meaning of
teamwork?! Okay, Steven, are you ready to drill down into the planet, to depths
never before reached by your species to stop the Cluster before it forms and
save your world?! - I don't know.
- Don't say that! Say we'll do it together and it's gonna be great! We're gonna
do it together, and it's gonna be great! Liar! - Ahh! - Wah! Unh! Ready or not,
we have a mission.
[Whirring.]
Increasing speed.
[Click.]
All right.
Bracing for impact.
It's actually two more hours to the Cluster.
Oh.
Wish I'd brought some tunes.
[Schmaltzy music plays.]
Uh, thanks.
[Music continues.]
It's kind of freaky down here, huh? - Why is that? - It's just dark and
cramped.
I can't even stretch out.
[Rumbling.]
[whimpers.]
How did you think you were gonna get everyone in here, anyway? I don't know.
They'd shrink or something.
- We didn't have a lot of time to plan.
- So, what is the plan? We have a drill.
We're going to drill.
Get ready.
We're about to penetrate the asthenosphere.
- Whoa! It's all lava.
- Lava is what comes out of volcanoes.
- That's superheated Peridotite.
- Peridot-ite? Yeah.
It's made of the same stuff as Peridots.
- You were made on Homeworld, right? - Mm-hmm.
- What was it like? - I didn't exist, then I did.
I don't have memories of it, just feelings.
I know I can never go back to Homeworld, but it's hard not to have some
feelings for where you came from.
But it's fine.
I have something different now.
- W-What's that? - You know you guys.
[Thumping.]
What's that sound? [Gasps.]
A gem mutant! They must have buried some prototypes with the Cluster.
[Thumping continues.]
They're all over us! They're attacking the drill! What do we do?! Pearl didn't
think it was necessary, but I never leave home without a blast cannon.
Something doesn't feel right about this.
- Then use the D-pad.
- No, it's just these things, we can't just leave their Gems out there.
They're going to form again later.
If I could just bubble them, then they'd be safe.
Come on.
We've got to help them.
There is no helping them.
They're too broken.
The beings who used to be in those shards are so shattered they don't know who
they are or what's happening around them.
They just seek out other Gems, looking for the missing pieces of themselves,
trying to make themselves whole.
These early experiments only combine two or three shards.
The Cluster will be a billion times bigger an inseparable fusion capable of
destroying worlds, starting with this one.
We're hitting some denser rock.
This is it! [Rumbling.]
[Whirring stops.]
Recovery depth achieved.
- Target found.
- Is that The Cluster.
[Rumbling.]
[Both gasping.]
What's happening?! [Warbling.]
It's too late! It's taking form! Steven, I'm sorry I couldn't save you or the
billions of other life-forms who matter far, far less to me.
- Do you have any last words?! - I love you, Peridot.
Wow.
Thanks.
[Thumping.]
It's still struggling to take its form! This means we still might have time!
There's still a chance! Just a little repositioning! [Groaning.]
Peridot, I don't think we should hurt the Cluster.
I don't think it knows what it's doing.
It doesn't matter if it knows what it's doing, it's still going to do it.
[Screaming.]
[Sputtering.]
[Grunting.]
What?! Is the increased vibration - causing damage to your head holes? - I
don't know! We're not even piercing the crust yet! I need to increase power!
Are you going to be okay? Yeah, yeah.
I think its just the noise - I think.
Keep going.
- Affirmative.
Activating triple-tip penetration mode! [Gasps.]
Runaway drill! [Grunts.]
There! Just got to keep balance! Okay.
[Screaming.]
Aah! Aaah! I don't know if it's going to hold! I don't understand what's
happening! [Grunts.]
- What's wrong?! - I don't know! [Warbling.]
[Panting.]
Steven! Steven?! [Panting.]
Peridot? Peridot?! [Indistinct whispering.]
[Gasps.]
[Whispering continues.]
Want to.
Need to.
You want to? Want to what? Form! Aaah! Please, stop! It's the Cluster.
I'm talking to the Cluster? But how did I get inside your brain? Brains? Must,
have to, want to, need to.
- Must, have to - [gasps.]
Wait! Please, don't take form! Want to, need to form! Form, form, form! Want
form! Want form! Form! [Whispering.]
Maybe instead of forming, you could do something else? Form! Boy, you've sure
got the one-trackiest mind I ever met! Need form! - Aah! - To be whole.
Whole? Oh, you're shards.
You just want to find the rest of your Gems.
But forming won't help you find the rest of yourselves.
You'll just destroy the Earth.
No, no, no, no, no.
But if you want to find other Gems, there's so many of you right here.
Look shard, meet shard.
- Have to.
- Want to.
See, you already have so much to talk about.
- Hello.
- Hi.
[Indistinct talking.]
This is great! You don't even need to form! You can just stay here! Want to
stay.
But can't stop! Going to form! Can't stop! Going to form! Help! Help! It's
okay.
If I just bubble you, you won't have to come out.
It'll keep you safe.
Here, look like this! I can bubble you! I can bubble you! I can bubble you!
[Panting.]
Well, that's five out of Oh, geez.
I'm sorry! I can't do it alone! [Clamoring.]
Whoa! [Grunting.]
Steven, wake up! - [Gasps.]
It doesn't want to form! - What?! We got to put it in a bubble! Bubble that?!
There's no way! [Gasps.]
They're bubbling each other! I've got you! You've got this! We've all got each
other! Both: Whoa! You did it! [Laughs.]
We did it together, and it was great! Huh? Guys, you're back! - Is Lapis okay?
- She'll be fine.
You look happy! Did you destroy the Cluster? - No, I talked to it! - What? It
doesn't want to destroy the Earth.
It just wants company, and it's got it now.
It's like a bajillion people! They'll have lots of time to get to know each
other now that they're in a bubble.
How on Earth did you bubble that whole thing?! We had a little help.

Want to.
Need to.
You want to? Want to what? Form! Aaah! Please, stop! It's the Cluster.
I'm talking to the Cluster? But how did I get inside your brain? Brains? Must,
have to, want to, need to.
- Must, have to - [gasps.]
Wait! Please, don't take form! Want to, need to form! Form, form, form! Want
form! Want form! Form! [Whispering.]
Maybe instead of forming, you could do something else? Form! Boy, you've sure
got the one-trackiest mind I ever met! Need form! - Aah! - To be whole.
Whole? Oh, you're shards.
You just want to find the rest of your Gems.
But forming won't help you find the rest of yourselves.
You'll just destroy the Earth.
No, no, no, no, no.
But if you want to find other Gems, there's so many of you right here.
Look shard, meet shard.
- Have to.
- Want to.
See, you already have so much to talk about.
- Hello.
- Hi.
[Indistinct talking.]
This is great! You don't even need to form! You can just stay here! Want to
stay.
But can't stop! Going to form! Can't stop! Going to form! Help! Help! It's
okay.
If I just bubble you, you won't have to come out.
It'll keep you safe.
Here, look like this! I can bubble you! I can bubble you! I can bubble you!
[Panting.]
Well, that's five out of Oh, geez.
I'm sorry! I can't do it alone! [Clamoring.]
Whoa! [Grunting.]
Steven, wake up! - [Gasps.]
It doesn't want to form! - What?! We got to put it in a bubble! Bubble that?!
There's no way! [Gasps.]
They're bubbling each other! I've got you! You've got this! We've all got each
other! Both: Whoa! You did it! [Laughs.]
We did it together, and it was great! Huh? Guys, you're back! - Is Lapis okay?
- She'll be fine.
You look happy! Did you destroy the Cluster? - No, I talked to it! - What? It
doesn't want to destroy the Earth.
It just wants company, and it's got it now.
It's like a bajillion people! They'll have lots of time to get to know each
other now that they're in a bubble.
How on Earth did you bubble that whole thing?! We had a little help.

**** Same Old World ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Birds and
insects chirping.]
It was so intense down there! We were already a few layers into the Earth's
crust when suddenly Wa-pamo! Ka-powie! All these gross Cluster limbs started
clawing at the drill! So, I whip out the old photon blaster and "pew! pew! P-
chow! Chow!" Take that, Cluster! And Steven was all, "my feelings!" And then up
and passes out on me! [Chuckles.]
Then everything started glowing, and well, yeah, wait.
[Clears throat.]
I'm sure Steven can fill you in on the rest since he's the one who saved us.
You should've seen it, right, Steven? Tell 'em what happened in there! -
Steven? - Hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.
[Murmurs.]
I see you're worried about your friend.
Yeah.
When I saw her in my dreams, it looked like she was fighting so hard to keep
Malachite from escaping.
Lapis spent an unbearable amount of time fused with Jasper.
The emotional and physical strain of that type of fusion, I can't imagine.
She's gonna need a lot of time to recover.
- [Sighs.]
You're right.
- Come on.
I'm dying to hear more about what happened underground.
[Chuckles.]
Okay.
[Clattering.]
[Grunts.]
[Gasps.]
- Lapis, you're okay! - Steven! - You're leaving.
- I have to, Steven.
I don't belong on Earth, not with the Crystal Gems.
- I never have.
- It's okay.
I understand.
I just wish we could've hung out more.
I feel like I only get to see you when something horrible's going on.
That's just how it is with me.
Steven thank you.
- Goodbye again.
- Bye [Grunts.]
Are you sure you want to stay? You could always come back to the temple with us
- and live in the bathroom again.
- No thanks.
I have seen what goes on in there.
Besides, I've grown accustomed to this place.
And I should probably fix the hole that I made with my giant robot.
Mm.
Okay, well, have fun redecorating! Well, that's everything and then some.
- Steven, you ready to go home? - All seat belts are fastened! - Peridot says
she's staying.
- Eh, it's probably for the best.
I don't think she would've fit in the van.
You guys go on ahead.
I'll catch up with you on Lion.
Sure, uh, okay.
I'll see you in a bit.
See yaaa! Now, where is that feline? Lion?! Hey, Lion?! [Inhales deeply.]
Le-e-e-e-e-on! I have a big steak right here in my hand for you! Whoops, I
dropped it, and it fell out of existence.
You can't hide from me for too long 'cause you love me so much! Whoa! Lapis!
[Grunting.]
Whew! [Squeaking.]
[Grunts.]
- I thought you left.
- I was leaving.
But then I realized I've got nowhere to go.
Who knows what they'd do to me back home after what I did to Jasper.
I can't go back to Homeworld, and I can't stay here.
- Sure, you can.
- What? You can totally stay here.
It doesn't have to be "here" here.
You can live anywhere.
You don't even have to stay in Beach City if you don't want to.
Ooh, y-you could live in Surf City or Sea City, Aqua Town, Bayburg, and that's
just the places I know of off the top of my head! - I can show you around.
- Really? Yeah.
We can find you a new place to live.
I really only know the tri-state area, but my phone's got a global positioning
system.
Oh, uh okay.
Let's go look.
- Ready, Freddy? - My name's Lapis.
[Grunts.]
- You okay like this? - Mm-hmm.
Uhhhh! Uhhhh! [Music.]
Uhh! [Laughing.]
[Train horn blows.]
Whoo! So, how about this? You could live out here in the country! No noise, no
rules.
It'd just be you becoming one with nature.
Whoa! - Why would I want to do that? - It's fun! If you lived in these trees,
you could build a giant bird's nest and have squirrels for pets.
You could eat acorn pie every night, and when it gets hot or it rains, you'd -
be protected by these nice leaves.
- Leaves? [Gasps.]
Lapis, look at this! This leaf turned orange.
That means the seasons are changing from Summer to Fall.
Soon, it's gonna happen to all the leaves on all the trees.
Wow.
- So, what do you think? - Oh.
I'm not sure.
That's okay.
There's plenty of places we haven't been yet.
- Come on.
- What's this? This must be Empire City! Isn't it cool? - It's very bright.
- Yeah, that's why they say, "what happens in Empire City never sleeps"! - So,
what does happen in Empire City? - Well, let's see if you lived here, you could
get a cool apartment and be a single gem taking on the big city.
You'd have a fun job at a local coffee shop and come home to a wacky roommate.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Aw.
Hey, what's that shadowy place over there? Oh, that's Jersey.
[Car horns honking.]
Is it populated by machines? No, those are cars.
They make a lot of smog, though.
[Coughs.]
Y-You'd like it in Jersey.
The people here seem to hate the Earth, too.
Man: Quit flyin' in our sky, ya mooks! Both: Pbht!! [Laughing.]
Wow.
Lapis, it's so beautiful up here! Eh, it's all right.
I guess I can see why you like it.
Hold on! [Pow.]
Whoa! - Check it out! - Whoo-hoo! [Both laughing.]
Hey, we made it out all the way over the ocean! [Laughs.]
I wonder how far out we are.
Oh, cool.
The galaxy warp! Um, Lapis? I'm slipping a little there, bud.
[Chuckles nervously.]
Lapis.
Lapis, I'm slipping! I'm gonna Uh, sorry! I'm sorry.
- This is where I was abandoned.
- What happened? Whoa.
It's like a mirror.
It was thousands of years ago.
[Birds chirping.]
I was only meant to visit for a short time, but I got caught [Explosion.]
in the middle of a war.
It was awful.
I tried to run, but I was picked up by a Homeworld soldier and confused for a
Crystal Gem and used as a tool.
They'd ask me, "show us your base.
Where is your leader?" I didn't know, and I couldn't say, " I'm not one of
them.
" It soon became clear that there was no hope in stopping the rebellion.
All of the Homeworld gems fled.
In all the panic of escaping Earth, I was left behind.
[Shatter.]
[Whirring.]
And there I stayed.
Freedom in my sight, but out of reach for ages.
Until I was found.
- [Sighs.]
Are you okay? - I'll be fine.
Let me take you back.
Are you sure you don't want to take a minute? It's fine.
I just want to get out of here.
Okay.
For a moment, I really felt like things were different.
But they're not.
No matter where I go, I'm trapped.
But you're not.
You're not underwater, you're not in a mirror.
- This time, you're free! - But I'm still on Earth.
Yeah, but nothing is still on Earth.
Everything's always changing.
The leaves the cities [Car horns honking.]
even Jersey changes.
My dad says the rest stops used to be pretty gross, but now they have sushi!
This isn't the same world that held you prisoner not anymore, and I know it
doesn't feel like home, but maybe that can change, too.
I know you can't go back to Homeworld, but if you stay here it'll be your
choice to stay here.
It's funny.
For all the time I spent on Earth, I barely saw any of it.
That's not funny.
That's super sad.
- I I want to see it.
- Yeah? - I want to stay here.
- Here? Like, "here" here? - Yeah, here here! - Yes, hear, hear, everybody! -
What are we talking about? - You?! Lazuli, nice to see you up and about.
What are you doing here?! This is my new home away from Homeworld! No, it's
not! It's mine! - Right, Steven? - Uh Oh, boy.

**** Barn Mates ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #
- # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven! Peridot: And then I'll
say, "hey, as one refugee to another, it isn't so bad that we can never go back
to Homeworld, am I right? Why don't we watch the sun come up and figure out
what we're going to do with all this time, eh, Lazuli?" And then she'll say,
"yes, Peridot.
as impressed as I was by you on the ship, I am even more impressed with your
new compact look and capacity for friendship.
I'm so glad we're going to be living together.
" Peridot.
Facet five.
[Click.]
- Let's begin.
- This isn't gonna work.
Wait, what? I really thought I would be living alone here.
Yeah, but this is even better.
Oh, here, how about this? I saw this on an episode of a tv show.
I didn't see how it ended, but I'm sure it worked out great.
We'll divide this place in half.
You'll both have your own space.
High ceilings, real wood floors, convenient location in the heart of the
country.
So what do ya think, roomies? I like the cut of your gem, Steven Quartz.
- No.
No way! - What's the problem? You're the one getting all the good stuff! You've
got the propeller and paint cans on your side! You can do tons with those! Ooh,
actually, I kind of want the paint cans.
You want to trade something? I don't care about paint cans.
- That's not the problem.
- Bah.
- What's wrong, Lapis? - It's her.
- Ugh? - She's the problem! I can't stand the thought of having to look at her
every day.
She's the one who dragged me back to Earth.
Hey, it wasn't my idea.
I was headed to Earth, and I needed an informant.
It should have been a simple mission.
Things didn't exactly work out for either of us.
You used me like everyone else did! But it's not like that anymore.
It's different now.
- I'm different.
- It's true, Lapis.
Peridot has really come into her own since she's been living on Earth.
I sabotaged my own mission! I helped save the Earth! I even yelled at Yellow
Diamond! She's probably sending a whole fleet to find me and shatter me right
now! I'm kind of a big deal.
A big, anti-Homeworld deal! Steven, I don't think this is gonna work.
Uh, um, maybe we could put up a curtain? Er, sorry.
I thought this was gonna be okay.
I forgot that the last time you saw each other wasn't so okay.
That was in the past.
It's not like that now! Aggh! - I know.
- But obviously she doesn't.
She's the one that needs to know! I want her to understand.
Aw, Peridot, that's sweet.
That's the "you" you need to show her.
- Show her my sweet? - I got you.
Cards are a great way to tell someone something if you can't be face-to-face
with them.
Or if they don't want to see your face.
You've got to give her a taste of the sweet version of Peridot.
Here, look.
It's you and Lapis holding hands! Where are our noses? Oh, that's kind of part
of my style lately.
Is not having fingers also your style? No, I'm I'm just bad at drawing hands.
Uh, so here's your part.
Come here.
Write an apology inside to Lapis so she knows how sorry you were about before,
and that everything is okay now.
If you write it from your heart, your feelings will reach her.
- Just try to be sincere.
- Hmm.
[Sighs.]
Peridot: Hey, Lazuli! Hey, Lazuli! Hey! - Ugh.
- Lazuli! Hey! Why isn't she responding? I'm not sure.
I thought she was up there.
- Lapis? - Huh? Are you up there? - Yes, Steven? - Go on.
Steven did the outside, and I did the inside.
"Sorry I interrogated you.
You were just full of such useful information.
That's a sincere compliment.
Peridot.
" The noses! One can only conclude that it was the lack of noses! It seems
illogical to me that it would be any of the writing elements.
It took me over an hour to compose it, and I was the most sincere, as per
Steven's instructions.
It could be she's just not much of a reader? - How about a gift? - Another
approach.
- Yes.
But what? - Hmm.
Think of things she likes.
Things she likes Lapis Lazulis are typically partial to water and flying.
Hmm.
Ah! [Gasps.]
- No.
- No? - Nuh-uh.
But if! - Yeah? - Nah.
- Yeah, that'd probably be overdoing it.
[Both sigh.]
Hmm.
Water I think you have something with that.
You can't see through those, right? Actually, yes.
But it's very blurry.
Good to know.
Well, here we are! H-2 oh, my gosh! It's a smaller than average lake! It's from
the hole when we drilled.
Peridot and I sealed it and filled it with water.
It's a gift for you.
You know, 'cause water's your thing.
[Chuckles.]
Pretty good, right? The barn's out here in the country, but now you can get
your moisture fix whenever.
Do all that water stuff you do.
Water? Seriously? - Yeah! - You do realize that I spent the last few months
trapped under the ocean, right? Sure! But I thought It was an endless, crushing
darkness.
Wet and bleak and suffocating.
Water was the tomb I lived in for those months.
- Tomb, you say? - Yeah.
I'm kind of taking a break from water right now.
- But thanks for the lake.
- Uhh.
[Groans.]
Don't worry, Steven.
It's not your fault.
Peridot: A pool! What a cloddy idea.
Of course she wouldn't like that.
There's nothing! Nothing! - Nothing! - There has to be something.
Something, something.
Maybe, uh, instead of something she likes, give her something you like.
A piece of you! Um okay.
How about m "Camp pining hearts" DVD? - Which season? - Five? - Trash.
- I know.
Ugh! Log date whatever.
Facet whatever! [Groans.]
Whatever! Clearly there is nothing important enough for me to give to Lazuli.
At least I have you, tape recorder.
Ta-da! See, the ribbon is even blue.
I got your number.
Uh, here.
I'll unwrap it for you.
When I was stuck here, Steven gave me this tape recorder as a gift, and I
didn't really get it at first, but it made me feel better.
Just to talk about all the weird stuff that was happening.
It'll help you, too.
You, uh, press the button to record, an-and th-then you talk into it.
[Click.]
I don't want your garbage.
[Shatters.]
Guh! What? Were you trapped in a tape recorder, too?! Look.
I get it, you know.
You're confused.
You can never go back to Homeworld.
This place doesn't exactly feel like home yet! You're alone! No one could
possibly know what that feels like! Oh, wait.
I do! We're the same! Except you don't have to be alone.
So, tell me, then, what you want from me.
And whatever that is [Sighs.]
I'll do it.
I want you to leave! Okay.
Lapis, why are you being so mean to her? She's really trying.
- Why do you trust her, Steven? - Because I know her! Lapis, you're not even
giving her a chance.
You should've at least gotten to know her before you decided you don't like
her.
Now it's too late.
And she's never coming back again.
Aaaaaah! Oh, she's coming back again.
Aaaaah! They're here! Aaaah! [Music.]
[Gasps.]
Run! What is that thing? It's a roaming eye, a Homeworld tracking vessel.
I told you I'm public enemy number one! [Whirring.]
- Ah! - Oh.
[Both sigh.]
[Screaming.]
[Whimpering.]
This is it, Steven! They're going to wipe my precious grin off the face of this
planet! Stay behind me! I'll protect you! [Gasps.]
- Holy smokes.
- Steven! - Holy smokes! - Are you all right? We saw the ship and came as fast
as we could.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Lapis saved us.
But it looks like Homeworld really has it out for Peridot.
Lapis: Peridot.
Are you okay? [Giggles.]
Umm [Chuckles.]
[metallic thump.]
[All gasp.]
[Music.]

[Grunts.]
Ha! Hoo-whoo! How-ooh! Hiya! [Grunts.]
[Gasps.]
What a lovely planet! [Humming.]
Wait! So we just get out and walk around? Ooh! Now, where's the gem the
scanners locked onto? Let's fan out and search the area! - Whoa, look at them
all.
- I knew it.
They're after me.
- This is the end of the line.
- You really weren't kidding.
I disobeyed a direct order from Yellow Diamond, and I called her a clod to her
face.
- Oh, honestly, you call everyone a clod.
- Yes, but not everyone has command over all the armies of Homeworld, waiting
for the word to shatter me! Peridot, we won't let them get you.
- But haven't I caused you enough trouble? - Don't worry, Peridot.
It's our sworn duty to protect anything that calls this planet home.
And that includes clods like you.
That's my word.
Listen up, everyone.
I have a plan.
Or should I say we have a plan? Hello, everyone.
Both: Ruby! Sapphire! Hu-u-u-gs! - Hello, Steven.
- So, what's the plan? [Chuckles.]
You got this.
Just act casual.
Yeah, casual.
[Indistinct conversations.]
Focus, Rubies! This is an important mission from Yellow Diamond, so we can't
mess it up.
Eh, hey, hey! [Chuckles.]
Uh, what are we all doing over here? Yeah, what are we all doing here? We're
here to retrieve the leader of the Earth mission! Hey, wait a second.
It seems like there are more of us than usual.
- There's supposed to be five of us.
- Five Rubies! One, two, three, four, five.
- [Chuckles.]
Never mind.
- Phew! The leader of the Earth mission must be around here somewhere.
Well, she's definitely not in that barn.
Whoa! I didn't see that before.
Maybe we should look around in there.
I'll go by myself.
Gah! Bye-bye! They want to search the barn.
- We heard.
- We saw.
- I'm scared.
- Let's ambush them! No.
No one needs to get hurt.
Let's be sensible.
- What do I do? [Whimpers.]
- Just go out there and tell them this is a place where Humans live.
[Sighs.]
I don't want to go alone.
Ooh! I'll come.
I'll be your backup.
And here's some backup for your backup.
I checked the barn, and I just found a bunch of Humans.
Yep! Nothing in there but us Humans! - Really? - Looks like we failed.
Time to go back home.
[Forced chuckle.]
I think we better double-check.
- You remember what happened last time.
- Last time? [Laughter.]
Oh, Ruby, you're so forgetful.
All right, let's search the barn! - Together: Yes, Ruby! - Wait! You can't bec
because, uh You have to, uh play baseball.
Yeah, it's a human thing.
If you win, you can go inside.
And if you lose, you got to leave forever.
Base ball.
All: Baseball? I saw that this was a possibility, though I am surprised that
this is the path we're taking.
[Whistle blows.]
All right, my human baseball knowledge will lead us to victory.
Let's just go out there and pretend to be Humans, except Peridot.
You stay here in the barn and hide.
Okay.
Everybody in? Lapis? [Chuckles.]
This plan sucks.
We're the Humans! Steven! - Earl! - Amy! - Bob! - And Sophie! Understood.
Our team is the Rubies, consisting of Ruby! - Ruby! - Ruby! - Ruby! - Ruby! And
Ruby! Here's the rules of the game we take turns throwing the ball at each
other.
The batter tries to hit the ball with the bat, and then they run around the
bases.
Whoever gets the most runs wins.
[Crowd cheering.]
Ah! You get three tries to hit the ball.
- If you miss - Strike one! What?! Strike two! [Grunts.]
- Strike three! - Three strikes, and you're out.
Oh, darn.
Mm, guess I'm out.
- Ohh! - You swung too slow! Do it like this! [Grunting.]
[Whack!.]
Hut, hut, hut! [Whistle!.]
Hut! And that's called a home run.
If the ball gets caught, you're out.
And if you get tagged, you're out! [Groans.]
Uh, and after three outs, we switch sides.
[Groans.]
[Pop.]
[Whack!.]
Whoa-ho-ho! [Whoosh!.]
Nice! Wow! That purple Human's really good! [Laughs nervously.]
Us Humans we're full of surprises.
[whispers.]
Amethyst, be careful! Hey, Ruby.
[Laughing.]
- Doc: Strike one! - Huh? Haven't I seen you somewhere before? I don't know.
I don't get off planet much.
[Both laughing.]
Strike two! What's going on? What are they doing? - Flirting.
- Uh-oh.
Strike three! [Pop.]
- Uh - Uh [Both laugh nervously.]
[Music.]
What?! Yeah! [Grunts.]
[All grunting.]
[Speaking indistinctly.]
[Bat whacks baseball.]
[Smack.]
[Groans.]
[Grunts.]
[Grunts.]
[Crack.]
Hey, how's it going? Are we winning? Um [laughs nervously.]
Now, what you want to do is lead with your hips.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
Let me show you again.
Well [laughs nervously.]
we're doing just fine.
Everything's gonna be a-okay.
- You're lying to me! - Steven: To make you feel better! Thank you! Steven: All
right, it's the bottom of the ninth.
We've got Lapis on second, but one more out and the game's over for us.
We need to hit a home run.
[Both laughing.]
Wait! I call a time-out! Listen, you two, I know it's hard being separated, but
we have to keep them out of the barn or they're gonna find Peridot.
Remember? Ruby, stop being cute, and, Sapphire, keep your eye on the ball.
- Pun intended? - [Snaps fingers.]
What did I just say? [Grunts.]
[Grunts.]
Doc: Strike one! [Bird cawing in distance.]
Come on! I know you can do it! [Groans.]
[Grunts.]
Doc: Strike two! - Just look at the ball.
- I'm trying, but all I want to look at is you.
Don't worry, you can look at me when you're running for home.
[Foosh!.]
[Grunting.]
Whoo-ah-ah! [Grunting.]
Aaah! [Whack!.]
[All gasp.]
[Grunting.]
[Whoosh!.]
[Majestic music plays.]
[Laughing.]
Yeah! [Grunts.]
[Breathing heavily.]
Come to me! [Both laughing.]
[All gasp.]
[Laughing.]
- Whoops.
- They're Gems! - We've been tricked! - What a turn of events! - Uh - Huh? W-
What? Sorry, guys.
Game is over.
That's it! Rubies, combine! [Warble!.]
[Ground rumbles.]
[Roars.]
[Screaming.]
Wait! Uh, wait! Stop! Don't hurt them! Oof! Oof! [Panting.]
Wait.
Oh, please, please! It's me you're after, right? I'm not gonna stand by and let
my friends fight my battles! Aww! Peri loves us.
Are you the Peridot assigned to the failed Earth mission? Not sure if "failed"
would be the right word to Where is Jasper? - You're looking for Jasper? -
Correct! Wait, but I'm the one who betrayed the mission, who called Yellow
Diamond a clod, the new leader of the Crystal Gems? - What? - Tell us where
Jasper is, now! [Gasps.]
Jasper um, we know where Jasper is.
- Well?! - Uh Neptune! She's on the planet Neptune.
[Wind whistling.]
Well, why didn't you say so? [Sighs.]
[Warble!.]
We all here? 1234 and Ha! 5.
- To the planet Neptune! - Let's move out, soldiers.
What a lovely-sounding planet.
- But we just got here.
- Let's go, newbie! Thank you.
[Warble!.]
[Zap!.]
[Whoosh!.]
- Man, Rubies are dumb.
- Not all of them.
[Pop!.]

****** Steven Universe (2013) s03e06 Episode Script ******
**** Steven Floats ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #
- # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Wind
whistling.]
We're finally home! Aww, hello house! Hello, bed! Mm! [Laughs.]
Hello, TV! We've got some catching up to do.
Hello, kitchen.
Hello, food! [Groans.]
- Uh-oh, did that cake go bad? - That was a cake? Hello, temple! Hello, beach!
Hello, town! And hello, my favorite place to get a snack, the Big Donut! Is
closed?! Oh, hey Steven.
Haven't seen you for a while! You missed all the earthquakes.
[Panting.]
I was out in the field, saving the world! - Wow, nice.
- Are you closing up? I really wanted a donut.
There's got to be at least one in there.
Sorry, I already set the alarm for the night.
But, Sadie! I've been gone so long, and all the food in our house went bad.
- And I'm just starving.
- Um, I think Fish Pizza is still open.
I don't know if I'm hungry enough for a meal.
But you're starving? No, I'm dying! Blegh! Well, if you're dead now, I guess
you can't come by tomorrow.
I won't be dead then! What happens tomorrow? If you didn't know, we started
baking our own donuts after that workplace-safety lawsuit got thrown out.
So if you get here tomorrow right when the shop opens, you can have the very
first, fresh - donut of the day.
- What an honor! First thing tomorrow, I'll be here right when the store opens
to taste your first delicious donut of the day! Yeah, sure.
Later, Steven! [Alarm clock beeping.]
Mm, 6:55 A.
M.
That should give me enough time to get to the Big Donut right when it opens at
7:00.
And I can start another beautiful, Beach City day.
[Sighs.]
It feels so good to be home.
Hello, Beach City! It's great to be back! Whoa! I jumped super high! I didn't
know I could do that! [Chimes.]
Oh, my gosh! This is a new power! It's like I'm super light! Whoop! I can jump
really high and float down really slow! Jump! Float.
Jump! Float.
Jump! [Music.]
And jump! Woman: The captain has turned on the seatbelt sign.
Looks like we've got some boys in the sky ahead of us.
Whoa.
[Music.]
Beach City looks so small from up here.
Oh man, I want to jump around funland! Huh? Hmm.
I guess it might take a while to land.
Maybe I shouldn't have jumped so high.
Oh, Steven, how do you keep getting in these predicaments? Hmm? Hey, it's
Amethyst! She could help me! Amethyst! Hey, over here! Yo, Steven! Are you
still up? Last chance for some cake! Ah, she can't hear me! I'm too far away!
[Grunts.]
No, no! Look up here! [Grunts.]
Hey! Who's the wiseguy? She saw me! She saw me! Oh, there's Steven, just flyin'
around.
[Chuckles.]
No, Amethyst, come back! Wait, can Steven fly? Yeah, I think I remember that.
No, no, I'm thinking of Lapis! Hey, Steven! How did you learn how to fly? -
Amethyst! Go get help! - What?! Ugh, she can't hear me.
- Hey, air-Steve! - Amethyst! I need you to - dang, too slow.
Better ask quicker.
- What'd you say? I could really use your assistance dealing with the sudden
appearance aw, rats.
of a power which previously was unbeknownst to me which I can't control umm.
- Dude, summarize! - Go get Garnet! - Hmm.
- Well, Garnet? - Hmm.
- What are you all doing? Steven is falling! He needs our help! I'll catch you,
Steven! - I think it's gonna be a while.
- Oh, oh, oh! [Glass shatters.]
[Car alarm blares.]
- I found a phone.
- Whose is it? That's not important.
[Ringing.]
Hello? Ground control to Steven Universe.
Pearl: Steven! Are you okay?! Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
See? He's got this.
Not exactly! I think this is some kind of new power! Rose could regulate the
speed of her descent.
Yeah, and she could control how fast she fell.
- That's what I said.
- Steven, try falling a little faster.
I can't figure out how, and it's taking forever to reach the ground.
Can you guys just keep me company until I land? [Music.]
[Grunts.]
Ooh.
[Music.]
Oh.
[Sighs.]
Is it a broom? No, it's a spear! [Alarm clock blaring in distance.]
Amethyst: Hey, Steven, why's your alarm going off? [Gasps.]
6:55 A.
M.
That should give me enough time to get to the Big Donut right when it opens at
7:00.
Fresh! Oh, nuts! My donuts! Guys, I need to get down right now! What's the
hurry, dude? You got nowhere to be.
He's clearly very tired from being up all night, and he's eager to get some
sleep.
There's no time to explain! Just help me down! How we supposed to do that?
Maybe we could weigh him down? It's not enough! Keep it coming! Oof! More,
more! [strains.]
I don't think this is working.
[All grunting.]
Nothing's working! Is there anything else you can put on me? Just this alarm
clock.
It's past 7:00.
Thanks for trying, guys, but there's no point anymore.
- Sorry, Steven.
- Sorry, Steven.
It wasn't meant to be.
[Grunts.]
[Sighs.]
[Distant crash.]
It was too meant to be.
[Sighs.]
My first day back, and it's already ruined.
I wonder who'll get my donut instead of me? Probably Peedee.
He'll be up for his morning jog.
Mr.
Smiley will have the second donut.
Lars will embezzle one.
Ronaldo will buy one that he thinks is a mutant.
Onion'll buy one and take it for granted.
And then Mayor Dewey will order a dozen, and then a dozen-dozen for the whole
town! And then a dozen-dozen-dozen for all the starving children in the world!
[Cheering.]
But not for Steven.
They'll say, "where's Steven? We saved a donut for him.
" But they won't see me because I'm in the sky.
And then, they'll feed my donut to a dog.
And then I'll die.
[Music.]
Alas, poor Steven! I knew him well.
Noooo! Huh? [Gasps.]
I'm falling! Oh geez, I'm falling.
Guys! Yeah, but if he did have a jet pack, he could just put it on upside down!
Uh, they still cant hear me! My phone! I dropped my phone! Why do my powers
just keep coming and going? I was just so happy to be home.
Wait! That's it! Happiness! My floating power's tied to my emotions! [Groans.]
Right, just like all my stupid powers! Ooh! Okay, right, I can control this! I
just have to think happy thoughts and no negative thoughts! So, what makes me
happy? Donuts? No, I'm not gonna get any.
The beach! No, that's where I'm going to die.
[Thud.]
Mom? Oh geez, those feelings are complicated.
Come on, come on, brain, time's running out! I just need something that makes
me happy! Something I can always depend on to cheer me up! [Music.]
My guys! They spent all night with me just to keep me company.
No matter how much I mess up, they'll be there to help me.
- But if he can't control his power - It's all right.
- How is it all right? - By now, Steven has realized his powers are tied to his
emotions.
Just like I knew would happen.
He's used the memories of happy and sad things to land safely behind us, ready
to give us a hug.
[Grunts.]
- Close enough.
- Guys! Wait! You have somewhere else to be! - What? - There's no time! Run to
the Big Donut! - Run! - Uh, okay! I would've liked a hug.
[Panting.]
[Gasps.]
No way! No way, no way, no way, no way! Ooh! Oh.
[Chuckles.]
Uh You're just opening? I thought I was late! Late? We always open at 7:30 on
Sundays.
Ahh, duh! Well, you're just in time.
Here you go! My treat! A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles! My favorite!
Ugh! - Oh! - Oh, bother.
Look at you go [Music.]
I just adore you I wish that I knew what makes you think I'm so special

Dad
****** Steven Universe (2013) s03e07 Episode Script ******
**** Drop Beat Dad ****
1 Later, mom! Aw, yeah.
This is gonna be sick.
Thanks again for helping me take all this stuff out, Steven.
No problem! I've always wanted to be a roadie.
Whether they're lifting the heaviest equipment, fighting off crazy fans, or
just offering moral support, roadies work behind the scenes to make all magic
onstage possible.
I only really need the lifting, but I guess we'll see what happens tonight.
Whoa! Maa! Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.
No, I can't be back before 10:00.
- I'm doing a show tonight, Yellowtail.
- Ma-ma-ma! Ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma! It is too a viable career! 80% of
Germans make their living deejay'ing! Why can't you just accept that I don't
want to be a fisherman like you?! - Uh Bye, Yellowtail.
- Mr-mr-mr.
- You okay, Sour Cream? - Yeah.
I just can't deal with my stepdad on my case all the time.
Why would I want to bring home fish when I could bring home sick beats? If he
wants to "muh-muh-muh" so much about it, he doesn't have to come.
Ugh.
All that arguing messed up my stomach.
I'm gonna go use the bathroom.
[Door opens, closes.]
Wait! Don't leave! Waxing is free! Oh.
What's up, Stu-ball? Just helping Sour Cream take his gear to the warehouse.
- Oh, like a roadie, huh? - Yeah! - W-What about you? - Well, same-old, same-
old.
- Not too busy.
- Don't worry.
- I'm sure it'll pick up soon.
- Thanks, kiddo.
[Horn honks.]
[Air brakes hiss.]
Whoa! Look at the size of that thing.
Steven, don't tell them about the free wax.
[rock music.]
- Marty? - You mean your rotten old manager? - I'll protect you, dad! - Eh,
don't worry.
I got a hose.
So, [Chuckles.]
this is where you work now, Starchild.
A rundown old car wash? Guess the music biz wasn't as good to you as it's been
to me.
Uh, hey, Marty.
Uh, long time, no see.
- This is my son, Steven.
- Whoa! Guess I'll call you Starchild Junior.
[Laughing.]
Ugh.
Anyway, uh, things are totally fine here in old Beach City, but, uh, if you
need me to wash that huge bus of yours, it'd probably help me out.
[Chuckles.]
Listen, Starchild, I can do you one better than a car wash.
You and I have some unfinished business.
Eh, sorry, Mr.
U.
I totally clogged up your toi Whoa! Dad? - Sour Cream? - W-What are you doing
here? Uh[Chuckles.]
S.
C.
Oof! Just look at you.
When did you get so tall? Uh, like nine years ago Whoa! [Chuckles nervously,
clears throat.]
Sorry I've been gone so long, but you know how the music biz can be, r-i-i-
ight? No.
Can you tell me about it? Well, you see, the music industry - is like a big
beehive or factory where - Man I can't believe they're related.
- You don't see the resemblance? - Mm Also, in the biz, they make it really
hard to have any free time at all.
- You got to work long hours - Kind of.
- every day and on weekends.
- Hey, Sour Cream.
Sorry to interrupt, but should I haul your equipment over to the warehouse
while you catch up with your dad? - What's this about equipment? - Hello! What
do you got going on over here, my friend? Just getting ready to set up for this
semi-annual deejay night - rave thing I do in Beach City.
- A rave, you say? Hmm [snap.]
S.
C.
, I have a great idea.
I've decided to hang out in Beach City and, um make up for lost time with you.
And while we're chillin', I'll promote your little engagement.
What's this shiny card with your contact info on it? Just a little something we
pro music types call - a laminated business card.
- That is so legit! Man, you're so lucky your dad is in the biz.
Throwing a cool semi-annual deejay rave thing is a classic father-son bonding
experience.
- More classic than fishing? - Just wait! We're gonna cram nine years of
bonding into one spectacular event! This is it? It's so puny.
I mean, what is this? A concert for ants? We could invite some ants.
Aunts, uncles music is for everybody.
Listen, buddy, you want to reach people, right? Yeah.
You want to hold them in your little hand, right? Uh, I guess so.
You want to squeeze them until their eyes pop out! Uh, you lost me a little.
What I'm saying is, if you want to bring people in, you can't play out in the
sticks! You got to be where the people are! Now this is more like it! We'll set
up right here in the sand.
[Clears throat.]
As Sour Cream's roadie, I have to voice my concern.
You threw a show here on the beach for my dad, and judging from what he said,
you didn't do a good job at all.
Okay.
Can I real talk with you for a second? Real talk.
I made a lot of mistakes before, when I was your dad's manager, and real talk?
I was a jerk.
But real talk I've learned a lot about myself and the music business since
then.
So I can tell you, with certainty, things aren't gonna be like they were last
time.
- Real talk.
- Wow.
Yellowtail never real talks with me.
That's what it's like to work with a professional, kid.
Now, hold on.
I'm gonna work some magic.
[Cellphone beeps.]
Marty here.
Talk to me.
Yeah, I know I called you Okay.
You ready? Boom! Sour Cream: Wow! Am I glowing? That's right.
Nothing less for my talented, soon-to-be-famous deejay.
- Check this out, broski.
- Wow.
I've only seen gear this good on the Internet.
- Is this for me? - It's for us, my main cool cat! Wow.
I can totally rave to this.
It looks like you're all set on roadies, huh? - Guess I'll just carry myself
home.
- Hey, Starchild Jr.
, catch! You're in the big leagues now, little roadie.
[Gasps, laughs.]
[Grunts.]
Geez! What does Greg feed that kid? - Uh - Hey, let me rap with you - about the
setup I have envisioned, okay? - Okay! So, the stage is gonna be huge, and the
speakers even huger.
[Humming.]
[Grunts.]
[Seagull squawking.]
Hmm? [engine whirring.]
[Dance music plays.]
[Indistinct conversations.]
[Audience cheering.]
Man: Steven Universe! Don't mind me, folks! Just a humble roadie doing a mike
check.
This mike looks great! Hey, Sour Cream, we're ready to go whenever you are.
Okay, I guess I'll go out and get started.
That's not how we do things in the music biz.
Let a proper hype man set the stage for you.
Whoa.
I've never been properly hyped before.
Thanks, dad! [Clicks tongue.]
[All cheering.]
It's some guy! How's it go is this mike even on? [Feedback.]
How you feeling, Beach Ci-tay! [All cheering.]
You know, I've always been someone with good taste, so you got to believe me.
This show is special to me.
It's personal.
Because I want to introduce you to a fresh, raw experience, to a whole new
flavor, to a brand-new - soda! - What? Guacol-a-a-a! [Audience murmuring.]
That's right.
Guacola! The world's first guacamole soda.
Each can comes with the power of three whole avocados! Now, come on, Beach
City.
Are you ready to guac? [Grunts.]
Oof! Ugh! [gulps.]
Ugh! This is terrible! What the from concentrate? [Audience groaning.]
Aww, that's nasty.
[Groaning.]
Ugh! It's not even good on chips! - Dad! - Steven, is this gross-out - drink
part of Sour Cream's show? - No way, dad! - It's all Marty! - Mrr-mrr?! Ma-ma-
ma-ma-ma! Ma-ma-ma-ma! Yellowtail, wait! Sour Cream needs you! What are you
waiting for? Start playing.
- Dad, you're ruining my show! - This isn't your show.
How do you think we have this setup this party bus, these roadies? I've got a
good deal with Guacola.
You're lucky I'm letting you in on the ground floor.
But I thought this was about making up for lost time, not some lame soda.
Look, kid, I need this Guacola deal, okay? - Don't be selfish! - Muh! Muh-muh-
muh! Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh! Muh-muh-muh! Muh muh! - What did you say? - Muh Ugh.
I said I don't need you or Guacola to do what I want to do! I never have! I can
do this show on my own! Fine.
[Feedback.]
Hey, Universe, I only came here because I'm legally obligated to give you this.
- Huh? - Don't say I never gave you nothin'.
[Engine starts.]
Well, I guess that's it.
So much for me and the music biz.
- I'm sorry, Sour Cream.
- [Horn honking.]
What's that noise? Ma ma-ma-ma-ma! Aw, man! It's my stepdad.
He was just waiting for me to fail so he could get me and put me to work on his
boat.
Fine.
Take me to your big smelly boat so I can fish my life away! Ma-ma-ma ma-ma-ma
ma-ma-ma.
It's my old gear? Ma-ma ma-ma-ma-ma-ma ma! - What? You want me to play? - Ma-
ma-ma, ma-ma-ma.
Gee Uh Thanks, yellow Dad.
- Ma-ma-ma! - [Laughs.]
Good one, Dad! Hey, Steven, since you're still my official roadie, - help me
set up.
- Yeah! Let's kick it! [Music.]
[All cheering.]
You know, the music biz can be really tricky.
I'm sure Sour Cream will make it big on his own.
Even if he doesn't make it big, Sour Cream'll be okay, as long as he's doing
something that makes him happy.
Eh, you know, it's not about the mone eeeeeeee! - Dad? - [Gasps.]
$10 million?! You're rich! Look at you go [Music.]
I just adore you I wish that I knew what makes you think I'm so special

without any shame and I know in my gut, it's been worth the 5.
95 would you like a burger from Pepe's Burgers? Steven: Whoa.
Your song is on TV! Yeah.
Apparently, Marty sold my song as a burger jingle, and now I'm filthy-stinking
rich.
[Sighs.]
The sweet stench of success.
- What is this? - You know, when Rose came to my concert the night we met, I
was playing this song.
This is what did it burgers? It wasn't about burgers back then.
She probably would have liked this, though, right? [Sighs.]
She would have loved it.
[Groans.]
[TV shuts off.]
So, what are you gonna do with all the money? I don't know.
Bright, sunny day [guitar plays.]
don't cost nothin' light, summer breeze don't cost nothin' what do I do with
all this money when the only thing I want is you? Pallin' around don't cost
nothin' singin' a song don't cost nothin' how do I spend all this money? I'd
rather just spend time with you You could buy a house and a car I guess that I
can but I've already got a van - # I could put you through college # - But I'm
with the Gems all the time.
I could buy you all the finest courses online - # What if we took a trip? # -
Hey, you think? Yeah, I do.
# We could take a vacation # We could go somewhere new.
[Up-tempo music plays.]

sounds and the buildings towerin' subways that runs from Brooklyn to the Bowery

Past experiences have taught me that three is a crowd.
Steven, me and Pearl haven't gotten along that well since, uh well, since I
started dating your mother.
Aw, come on! We're all a big family.
It'll be great.
Just you, me, Pearl, and don't forget mom.

This city's got its charm, unlike that termite-ridden barn.
And any time with Steven makes for a delightful evenin'.
- # You're having fun! # - # More or less.
# - # So dance with me.
Just say # - No! I I mean maybe later.
Boo! You ruined the song! Sorry, guys.
Thanks for singing with us.
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
It's always been this way.
[Both snoring.]
[Sighs.]
[Music.]
[Sighs.]
I was fine with the men who would come into her life now and again I was fine
'cause I knew that they didn't really matter, until you I was fine when you
came and we fought like it was all some silly game over her, who she'd choose
after all those years, I never thought I'd lose it's over, isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it over? It's over, isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it over? You won, and she
chose you and she loved you, and she's gone It's over, isn't it? Why can't I
move on? War and glory, reinvention fusion, freedom, her attention out in
daylight, my potential bold, precise, experimental Who am I now in this world
without her? Petty and dull with the nerve to doubt her what does it matter?
It's already done now I've got to be there for her son It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it over? It's over, isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it over? You won,
and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone It's over, isn't it? Why
can't I move on? It's over, isn't it? Why can't I move on? [Gasps.]
Greg! You were awake.
Nothing's gonna fix this, is it? Greg! I'm sorry you had to be around me.
- Dad! - I shouldn't have come along.
No.
This is exactly why I brought you.
[Music.]
[Groans.]
Cherry man.
[Clears throat.]
[Ragtime music plays.]
[Gasps.]
Ooh! Roo-doo-doo-doo, roo-doo-doo-doo Why don't you talk to each other? Why
don't you talk to each other? Just give it a try Why don't you talk about what
happened? I know you're trying to avoid it but I don't know why You might not
believe it you might not believe it but you've got a lot in common you really
do [both sigh.]
You both love me, and I love both of you Greg: Look, if I were you, I'd hate
me, too.
Pearl: I don't hate you.
But I knew how you felt about Rose, and I stayed anyway.
- That wasn't the problem.
- Then what was? - She fell in love with you.
- Well, you know Rose.
Both: She always did what she wanted! Steven: # I know you both need it # I
know you both need it someone who knows what you're going through and you might
not believe it you might not believe it but you've got a lot in common you
really do You both love me, and I love both of you you both love me and I love
both of you [cheers and applause.]
Man: Hurray! [Both laughing.]
- Ricky: Le bill.
- Ugh! Tailor-made suits those cost somethin' room with a view those cost
somethin' - # Dancing with you # - # Don't cost nothin' # Why'd we even come?
We could have done this at home.
[Laughing.]
Singin' a song don't cost nothin' Or was it palling around don't cost nothin'?
- # Getting it wrong # - # Don't cost nothin' # I tried.
I'm surprised you remembered any of it.
What can I say? It's catchy.
It's over, isn't it? It's over, isn't it? It's over, isn't it? [Pop!.]
# Look at you go # # I just adore you # # I wish that I knew # # what makes you
think I'm so special #

**** Too Short to Ride ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #

Special delivery.
Oh.
Wow.
Thanks.
It's a - A rectangle.
- And a tablet.
My dad bought it, but he decided he didn't need it.
He said something about oversaturation of media being a plague to one's mind.
So I thought you might like it.
Here.
[Gasps.]
- You use your fingers to work it.
- Like my old finger screens.
But now you have the whole world wide web to hang out on.
World wide? Ha.
I had the ability to search and retrieve data - from across multiple star
systems.
- Hmm, impressive.
But I can do you one better tubetube.
[Cat yowling.]
Why was this documented? You can log your thoughts on the Internet, too.
You just have to keep it under 140 characters.
That's so many people.
[Clattering.]
I'll make you an account so you can start logging as soon as you want.
[Chuckles.]
I really, really like this, but it's a shame it doesn't come attached to your
body.
[Gasps.]
Oh, wait.
I'm gonna leave the profile stuff blank for you - to fill in later.
There.
- Gimme.
[Laughs.]
Behold my innovation.
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.
Haaaaa.
Shing.
Shing.
Haaaaaaa.
Shing, shing! I've harnessed the power of your interlocking fabric strips.
[Chuckles.]
Good thing I grew out of those shoes.
[Sighs.]
To have tech again.
It feels so good when everything is at your fingertips.
Yo.
You guys look like you're having fun.
Oh, Amethyst.
What do you think? - You look like a square.
- It's a rectangle.
Heh, truth.
Anyway, you two ready to go or what? - Go? - Yeah.
Amethyst and I were gonna go hang out, - and we wanted you to come, too.
- Hang out? Oh, yeah.
That's a friend thing to do.
So, where are we hanging out, friends? Ta-da! Welcome to Funland! You've
brought me to a sign! Nah, nah.
You got to go inside.
[People screaming.]
[Chuckles.]
A speed pattern transportation circuit.
And a roller coaster.
You got to do the most fun thing in Funland first.
Hmm.
Bold.
Let's follow this logic! [Bell dinging.]
- Three, please.
- Sure.
We got some new rules, first.
[Ding!.]
Uh [Ding!.]
Ugh.
[Ding!.]
Hmm.
[Grunts.]
[Growls.]
Ha-ha! Sorry, guys.
Looks like this squad has some growing to do - before you can ride.
- I do not have to grow.
This height is indicative of my rarity and importance.
I demand entry, you clod! [Clears throat.]
- You kids want another lifetime ban? - No, thanks, Mr.
Smiley.
Shorty squad out.
Well, that stinks.
[Sighs.]
We'll just have to maintain a healthy lifestyle in hopes we grow before the end
of the season.
Ugh.
Of course.
Let's just grow.
[Gasps.]
Shape-shifting! Hmm.
[Grunting.]
Uh, Peridot? [Breathing heavily.]
Uh, I I must be a little rusty - Why don't you two just go? - Aw, what? - What.
- You sure? Sure I'm sure.
I can just look up what a roller coaster feels like.
Just hurry up and go so you can hurry up and come back.
Oh, okay.
[People screaming.]
- So good.
- What next? What next? Yes.
What next that doesn't have a height restriction? Uh, there! Ooh.
[Giggles.]
[Both laugh.]
Ha, this place is fun.
Yeah.
It totally does live up to its name.
[Sighs.]
Let's see who can eat the most chili dogs before we go on the tilt-a-whirl.
[Gasps.]
Steven, Amethyst! Look at this being.
Its large head, swollen with thoughts! Those compassionate eyes.
It understands.
I need it.
Now! Peridot, that's a prize.
You have to win it first.
[Dings.]
[Breathing heavily.]
[Grunts.]
Hey, there, Steven.
Mr.
Smiley, you're working the ring toss, too? Yeah.
You could say we're a little "fun-derstaffed.
" [Chuckles.]
I get it.
I'm glad you seeing the humor in it, Steven, because I haven't seen a bed in
six days! Oh.
[Chuckles nervously.]
Hyah! [Clatter.]
- I win! - Um, well You have to land the rings first, broski.
Shorty squad throw! [All grunting.]
Okay, last chance.
We got this.
[All sigh.]
- This biz is rigged! - I didn't save Earth for this.
Sorry, Peridot.
Hmm.
No.
We're gonna get you that prize.
Hey, Mr.
Smiley.
Is that Onion trying to light the roller coaster on fire? I'm not falling for
that one again.
[Screaming in distance.]
Oh! No! I'm still paying off the last lawsuit! Heh.
Good old Onion.
All this runnin' around.
I'm not even in a union.
Amethyst: Yo, Mr.
S.
While you were gone, Peri got a ring.
- I did? - [whispers.]
We're lying.
Oh, uh, yes, I did land the ring.
I also do not steal Steven's clothes when he's not looking.
- Steven: What? - Huh.
Would you look at that? And I thought this thing was rigged.
Here you go, kid.
It's a little sister.
[Laughs.]
Um, excuse me, but you're wrong.
- I'm supposed to win that one.
- You mean the big guy? Sorry.
That one's 10 rings.
Find cute roommates in your area.
- I'm all set, thanks.
- That toy you won is really cool, Peridot.
You mean that Amethyst won with shape-shifting.
Maybe they should call it shape-shift land, because it's a land where you go to
shape-shift.
What's wrong with shape-shifting, bro? You mean besides being an insult to your
intended form? - Okay, what's really wrong with it? - I can't do it At all.
- Well, we can help you try.
- What? I didn't ever think I could use my powers, either, but then the Gems
helped me out.
- We can help you, too.
- Yeah, man.
[Munches.]
Mmm! We'll give you the shape-shifting lowdown.
[Grunts.]
Shorty squad style.
[Music.]
Ah? Mm.
Ta-da! [Grunts.]
[Cat yowls.]
[Whimpering.]
[Sighs.]
[Chuckles.]
Hup! Hup! Whoa.
[Groans.]
Uh, okay.
Maybe we just have to activate it manually.
You grab her feet.
I'll grab the arms.
- Okay.
- Ready? Pull.
[Both grunt.]
Ow.
- Is it working? - Ow.
- I think so.
- Ow.
- Pull harder! - Ow.
- I think I just heard a crack.
- Ow.
- That's her powers opening, Steven.
- Ow, ow, ow.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Drop me now.
[Grunts.]
This isn't going to work.
- Maybe if we keep trying - No.
My lack of skill is an objective fact.
I'm an era-2 Peridot.
I'm new.
Resources are dwindling on Homeworld.
They can't make Gems like they used to.
That's why they give era-2 Peridots technological enhancements.
Because we don't have powers.
Per, I'mma be really real with you for a sec.
This whole time we've been here, you've just been focusing on what you can't
do.
Of course you're not having any fun.
You think that all you are is who you could be, but we don't hang out with you
because of who you could be.
We like you.
I know you just heard me.
Stop playing with that thing.
- Ugh.
Gimme that! - No! - You don't need it! - You don't know that! Yes I Do! Wait.
W-W-W-W-Wait.
No! It's all that I am! Peridot.
Metal powers! Dude.
[Giggles.]
Do you know what this means? You can open really tight jars.
You can remove staples without a staple remover.
You can open doors without having to touch them after you wash your hands.
No.
I know exactly what I can do.
[Snores.]
- 10! That's 10! - Wah! That's 10, all right.
Well, I guess you won fair and square, or fair and triangle.
[Mr.
Smiley laughs.]
Because your head looks like a triangle.
Here you go, kid.
You did it, Peridot.
Give it up for pea-pod! No, give it up for the shorty squad.
Look at you go I just adore you I wish that I knew what makes you think I'm so
special

your consideration The koala, a marsupial from the forests of Australia, and
the sloth, hailing from the forests of South America.
Who should be crowned the king of the "hanging around, doing nothing" mammals?
- I think sloths eat poop.
- Gross.
Well, that's definitely going to affect the rankings.
Eating poop would be better than this.
[Snickers.]
Just let him do his thing.
So glad I don't have to deal with this tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, they're closing shop to get those gulls - out of the vents.
Any plans? - Nah.
Would you Want to come by my place? I know it's kind of been awhile, but we
could get some food, watch some movies.
Nah.
Sounds boring.
I'll see if Buck wants to do stuff.
Well, I hope you guys have fun together.
Yeah.
We will.
Hey, Steven? You're staring a little bit.
No, I'm not.
[Doorbell chimes.]
Hey, Lars? Why didn't you want to hang out with Sadie? [Grunts.]
I see her at work.
Why do I need to see her on my day off? But aren't you going to get married,
and have kids, and name one of them after his Uncle Steven? Oh, let me think
No! Me and Sadie aren't getting married.
We aren't even dating.
And if she thinks we are, that's her problem.
You're lying! I know how you feel about Sadie.
You don't know what you're talking about, so butt out! Go annoy someone else.
You little weirdo.
Why can't you just admit you love her?! [Grunts.]
Lars.
Lars? You don't need to be such a jerk all the time.
I wish I could just show you.
Aah! Aah! Huh? Wha? Whoa! Wait a minute! This isn't the temple.
This isn't my voice.
Whoa I'm Lars? Ooh! [Whimpering.]
I'm naked! I must've jumped into Lars' mind.
I guess while I'm in here, I'd better do my best to respect Lars' body, and his
privacy.
No.
We can do this, Dante.
We have to talk to him.
Hi, there.
Oh, there's our boy.
How are you feeling? - Uh taller? - Here you go.
Oh, it's good to see you this morning, Laramie.
- Who's Laramie? - I mean Lars.
Now, Lars, we know school is a touchy subject, but we need to talk about this.
"F-f-f-f-f-f-b-d-f.
" That doesn't spell anything.
Please, Lars.
We let you move into the attic, and your grades are still below average.
All we're asking from you is Both: A little effort! Wow.
You guys seem so nice.
I'm sure I don't want to let either of you down.
I, Lars, promise to go out and do my very best at being your son.
Wow.
He didn't even swear.
And he's wearing the plugs I got him.
I'm Lars.
[Chuckles.]
I'm Lars, I'm Lars, I'm Laaaars! Hey, Onion? Look.
I'm Lars.
I'm Lars for the day Hey, it's Buck and Sour Cream.
Hi, guys! Whatcha doing? Hanging out? - Yeah.
- That's cool.
Would you say you hang out more like koalas or sloths? - I'm asking for Steven.
- I like that kid.
Yeah, he's the best.
[Chuckles.]
Tell Steven we're more like sleeping tigers.
Okay.
Then I'll be a panther.
[Growls.]
[Chuckles.]
- Oh.
Hey, Lars.
- Hi, Jenny.
Ugh.
Dad made me work this morning.
- Now I stink like Pizza and fish.
- You don't stink.
Lars?! What a nice thing to say! I can say way nicer stuff.
Like you're really cool and pretty and fun to be around.
[Laughs.]
Lars, this is so unlike you.
- I see what's going on here.
- Huh? This isn't the Lars we know.
Maybe Lars is actually a good guy who likes making people feel good.
Yep.
You got me.
That's the kind of vibe I want on our dance crew.
[Gasps.]
Lars is going to be psyched! Buck is pleased.
- Can he dance, though? - Can I? [Humming.]
- Whoa! Lars got moves! - Whoo.
We going to a dance competition, and we need you.
Come with us.
[Gasps.]
Oh.
Sorry.
I can't.
There's someone who needs me more.
[Knocks.]
[Buzzer.]
Okay, okay, geez.
Hold your horses.
Still want to hang out? Well, if it ain't the human boomerang always coming
back to me? Look, sorry.
I was going to watch a movie, if if you wanna? I don't I don't know.
[Laughs.]
- N-Nothing fancy.
- I don't need anything fancy.
[Laughs.]
Just get in here.
Are those hearts in your ears? There's a bunch of stuff down there you probably
haven't seen yet.
Take your pick.
"Night Terrors," "Enjoy the Violence," "Critter Crematorium," "The Organ
Pickler, part 7"? I keep telling you, that's the good one.
How about this? "Fangs of Love.
" I think I'd rather have my organs pickled.
And you love me? Even like this? I dooooooo! [Howls.]
[Laughs.]
Didn't I try to warn you? [Crying.]
They just wanted to be together.
[Sobbing.]
Hey? What is with you tonight, huh? [Sniffling.]
What do you mean? [Blows nose.]
[Sniffles.]
Look, it's like yesterday I asked if you wanted to come over, but you made a
big deal, saying no in front of Steven, and now you're here? It's just, it's
getting to be - kind of a roller coaster, isn't it? - Roller coasters are fun.
[Sighs.]
It's like you're one way in private and a different way in public.
You act like I don't know you don't want to be seen with me, but I do know.
I'm not stupid.
- Don't be sad.
- It's just, I need to know.
How do you really feel about me? Isn't it obvious? I love you.
Ugh! What are you doing?! - Finally telling you! - Nuh! Are you kidding me?!
All right, I get it.
I see how it is.
Some cute little heart gauges, some dumb, fluffy movie, that's enough for
Sadie.
Right, Lars? Uh, d I-I-I just wanted to fix everything.
Get out! [Grunting.]
Stop.
You're hurting me! - Sadie: Good! - You don't understand! I understand enough!
You're only my friend when it's convenient for you.
Just get out of my life! [Gasps.]
I'm not Lars! What?! I'm Steven.
I just woke up this morning with my mind in Lars' body.
Ugh! I didn't mean to hurt your feelings like this.
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.
Maybe you are Steven.
Lars would never apologize to me.
Wait.
So does this mean Lars' mind is inside your body? - I don't know.
- You don't know?! - Maybe we should check? - Ya think? At least we got second
place.
[Both panting.]
Hey, look, it's Lars and doughnut girl.
It seems like Lars is really turning a corner.
Oh, speak of the devil.
Where's he going? Who's that girl? - Let's follow him and find out.
- [Chuckling.]
Oh, Martha! [Grunting.]
It's locked.
[Grunts.]
Hyah! Why are they breaking into Steven's house? Our Lars a burglar.
Now, now, you know we've been ready for this day.
[Both panting.]
There you are.
How do you switch back? This looks weird, but don't jump to conclusions.
[All gasp.]
Come on, wake up! [Slaping.]
Steven: [Groaning.]
Aah! - Guhhh - Oh! [Gasps.]
What's going on? Mnh.
Huh? Sadie? [Gasps.]
How did I get here? What are all you doing here?! - Lars, don't get mad.
- Huh?! - But Steven really didn't mean to - You! What did you do?! I spent the
day with my mind in your body.
[Gasps.]
Unh! Aah! - Whoa.
Where's your chill? - Buck is no longer pleased.
I'm so sorry.
He wasn't like this this morning.
I was acting weird all day and you all just liked it?! Please don't make a
scene, Laramie.
Mnh! [Inhales deeply.]
Daah! [Music.]
[Doorbell chimes.]
Hey, Lars? Um I'm really, really sorry about yesterday.
I got you a card.
It's got a koala and a sloth.
I hope I didn't ruin your friendship with Sadie.
With Sadie?! Oh, what did you say to her? I said you loved her.
[Thud!.]
A-And what did she say? She thought you'd only say something like that to hurt
her.
Yeah.
I guess she's right.
Maybe that's why everyone liked the you me - better than the real me.
- Not everyone.
- Uh, hey.
- Hey! [Panting.]
Weird day yesterday, huh? [Chuckles.]
Ugh.
Every day in Beach City is weird.
- That's why I hate it here.
- It's good to see the real you.
Yeah? Uh, uh, you should come over later, you know, bring a movie to watch or
something.
- [Laughs.]
Okay.
- Awesome.
Look at you go, I just adore you I wish that I knew what makes you think I'm so
special

**** Beach City Drift ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #
- # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # They told
me there wasn't enough room on the road for the Universe.
And I told them, the Universe is my road.
Vroom, vroom! Steven? Steven? [knocks.]
Oh, hey, Connie! Thanks for letting me practice, Ddad.
This car's great! But I think it might be too small to live in.
Ah, the van's still home sweet home.
I just thought now that I'm swimming in dough, - why not get a new car? - A new
car? But it's got this big "used" sticker on it.
I like to think of it as more "experience" than "used.
" This baby's a Dondai Supremo from the era of frosted tips, mood rings, slap
bracelets.
You know, before you kids were born.
What a time to be alive.
I've had my eye on the Dondai since way back when.
I loved that car.
I wanted that car.
Also, these things are crazy on the road.
Front wheel suspension, tons of ponies.
But best of all it has a tape deck! [Chill music plays.]
[Both laugh.]
[Rock music plays.]
[Engine revving.]
[Tires screech.]
[Coughing.]
Give me a wash, old man.
Uh, right away, young man.
- Is that? - Kevin! I didn't say iron the socks.
I said I want my socks pressed.
Whoa wait, wait.
Careful with the tires, grandpa.
I got a big race today, and my car has to look as beautiful as me.
Back off, Kevin! He's not a grandpa! He's just a regular pa! [Click.]
Have we met before? I think I'd remember a twerp like you.
You do remember a twerp like me! [Chuckles.]
You You just look like another guy we know.
That's impossible.
There's only one Kevin.
[Tires screech.]
Hey! He forgot to - Eh, what do I care? I'm rich.
- [Growls.]
I hate Kevin! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the four letters, Schtuball.
Hate's a strong word.
It's a strong feeling, too.
- Do you know that guy? - Well, kinda.
When we fused into Stevonnie, we met him at the dance and - He was a creep! -
Steven! That's five letters! He kept asking us to dance with him, even though
we said no.
It was really uncomfortable.
He didn't even care about how we felt at all! [Sighs.]
I had no idea that happened.
I'm really sorry.
That guy, he's not even worth the time of day.
Don't even give him the satisfaction of thinking about him.
Thanks, Mr.
Universe.
[Sighs.]
- Still mad about Kevin? - Yes.
- Me too.
- You don't seem mad.
I'm thinking mad.
I still feel like there's something big I want to say to him, you know?
Something to make him think, like we're thinking.
Yeah.
Too bad we can't just race against him to use the first place ribbon - to wipe
that smug look off his face! - But we're kids.
Kids can't drive.
That's against the law.
We weren't kids when we met Kevin.
- I smell what you're steppin' in.
- Ew.
[Tires screech.]
Ugh! My practice didn't pay off at all! That was so bad! [Techno music
pulsing.]
I know, baby, I'm the worst.
[Scoffs.]
Anyone else think they can beat me and my Himitsu X-12 on the downhill course,
step right up.
Come on, how am I going to get a cool-down lap if no one wants to go? [Engine
revs.]
- I'll race you! - Huh? Ah! Aah! Ha! Is that a '96 Supremo? [Excited
whispering.]
Uh I think it's a Dondai? - A Supremo is a Dondai! - Wow.
Really? Are you saying you don't know the true power of the Supremo? - Uh -
Kevin: Ha! That's why I knew those brats at the car wash they're you! Your
whole "two kids in a beautiful trench coat" routine won't fool me this time, so
don't even try it! You don't know what you're talking about.
I'll show you what I'm made of when I beat you at this race! - Heh.
I see what's going on here.
- Do you? You've had a taste of Kevin, and now you're obsessed.
What? I get it.
I have that effect on people.
It's cute.
But aren't I a little old for you? Gah! Do you want to race or not?! The start
is at the top of the Mountain.
We go when the clock strikes the hour.
First one to the bottom wins.
But you don't have to worry about that last part.
Ah.
[Growls.]
[Tires squeal.]
[Coughing.]
That guy is going down.
[Crickets chirp.]
[Engines idling.]
[Growls.]
You know, this Mountain pass has some really beautiful views.
Shame you'll only be seeing - my tail lights the whole time.
- You wish.
[Mid-tempo music plays.]
It's Kevin time.
[Engine revs.]
Shoot! [Tires screech.]
Hm.
I won't let you win! Ha ha! [Laughs.]
Oh.
Oh, my gosh.
This is it! - Are they gonna crash? - No! We're about to witness the true power
of the Supremo! Oh.
[Tires squeal.]
[Chuckles.]
Huh? So you do know how to use that thing.
[Laughs.]
[Growls.]
[Engine revs.]
I know you want to be close, but this is a little clingy.
Ugh.
- Feel like giving up yet? - Oh! Why do you have to be such a jerk all the
time? The truth is I don't mean to be this way.
I-I just lash out because of my little brother.
[Inhales sharply, sighs.]
He's sick.
Been sick all our lives.
Sometimes I think if I act real cool and never let anyone see my pain, then
maybe the pain will go away.
And maybe I can take his pain away, too.
Kevin, I had no idea.
[Sniffles.]
[Laughs.]
Dude! I don't even have a brother! I'm like this because I think it's funny!
[Growls.]
Chowzers.
Kevin! [Grunts.]
What's happening? Kevin [Gasps.]
Oh! No! We have to beat him.
He deserves to lose! [Screams.]
[Crickets chirp.]
[Panting.]
A-Are you okay? - I think so.
Are you okay? - Yeah.
[Both sigh.]
Seems like the car is safe, too.
- What are you doing? - What are we doing? We're getting Kevin back.
We're about to beat him at his own game! Yeah, but why do we even have to play
his game? Because he's he's - Dagh! - I know! So why should he get to have any
say over how we feel? - He doesn't.
- But he's the reason we're racing.
Steven, he's the reason we fused.
[Gasps.]
We are obsessed with him.
I want to finish this race but not for him.
Right.
For us! The Supremo isn't moving! Ugh, that's it.
I'm gonna go up there and check if they're okay.
Wait! [Engine revs.]
[Tires squeal.]
[Music.]
Finally.
You caught up.
I was worried you'd miss seeing me win.
What, so you're shy now? What? Connie: Whoa.
[Giggles.]
[Growls.]
Aw! I was rooting for you, Dondai! Kevin is the worst! Boo! What, what? That's
right! First place, baby! It's like I invented winning.
Good race.
You trying to kiss my hand with your hand or something? You know, Kevin, you
were right.
[Scoffs.]
I know.
About what? The view from the Mountain was pretty great.
Hey! Don't try to teach me a lesson! You lost! Second place isn't so bad for my
first time driving a car.
[Scoffs.]
Look at you.
You're so obsessed with me, you're gonna drive away.
Fine! Go play with some kiddy toy cars! I could beat you at that, too! Don't
forget, you're obsessed with me! Obsessed! Obseeeeessed! Look at you go I just
adore you I wish that I knew what makes you think I'm so special

**** Restaurant Wars ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #

the - Just hurry up and say it, Steven.
Mm, actually what else you got? You could order actual fries.
Nah.
Let's really try and shake things up today.
I want to order "off menu.
" [Sighs.]
You always order off menu, Steven.
Let me see what I can find.
I'll be back in a sec.
I really appreciate it! [Birds chirping.]
Steven! Check this out! - Boom! - Mozzarella sticks! - With all the fixin's?! -
I can't believe it either! They were way back in the freezer for some reason.
Feels good to fry something else for a change.
Thanks, Peedee.
[Humming.]
[Munches.]
Steven! What is this?! - Um - Bread cheese marinara sauce! The basic elements
of a pizza! - Where did it come from? - Mm.
Fryman infringing on my business.
I have been ready for this day! [Muffled.]
"Now serving fries!"?! So it begins anew.
Eh, Kofi? Just like old times, Fryman.
- Kofi! - Fryman! Both: Res-tau-rant wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-r! [Gull cries.]
Oh! Man: Too many carbs.
Peedee? Don't look at me, Steven.
- But - I said, don't look at me! - W-What happened? - I violated the food
treaty.
- What do you mean? - Years ago my dad and Kofi signed an agreement to not
steal each other's business, but when I fried up those mozzarella sticks, I re-
ignited the hot oil of war.
[Sighs.]
Don't blame yourself.
I was the one who wanted to shake things up.
- Oh, yeah.
It's your fault.
- Hey, Steven! As a valued customer, I want to know your thoughts on our new
menu item deep-fried pizza.
A-Actually, could I just get some fries? - Sorry, we're all out of fries.
- What?! Even the bits?! We have pizza bits now.
But how can you guys be out of fries? This is the Fry Shop! You're Fryman! -
Look at your hair.
- What about my hair? [Groans.]
I can't connect to Fish Stew Pizza's Wi-Fi! Hey, you got no time for
Interneting.
You're doing deliveries now.
But I don't even have a car! - You got those wheelie shoes, don't ya? - Yeah
[Phone rings, bell jingles.]
- Jenny, you're working the counter? - I know, right? Things have been crazy
since the war has been back on! The phones have been ringing off the hook.
I'll get it! Thanks for calling Fish Stew Pizza.
We do fries now.
Anyway, I'm obligated to tell you about our special new menu item French-fried
pizza with a French-fried crust and twice-baked French fries on the side.
[Sighs.]
'Cause we do fries now.
- I'd rather just have my usual - Steven! - Oh.
Hey, Kofi.
- Before you place your order, you must sign [grunts.]
these papers and pledge your allegiance to Fish Stew Pizza! Not only that,
you'll be issued a brand-new, permanent, - V.
I.
P.
pizza-eater card! - Aah! [Bell jingles.]
Steven! [Breathing heavily.]
Come back! Hey, Steven, y-you forgot your pizza bits! - What? Aah! - Steven,
let me reward you for being such a good customer! Aah! What have I done?! Thank
you all for coming.
Ronaldo Kiki Jenny and Peedee, I've called you all here tonight because this
war between your parents has to stop! Steven, how do you think we feel?! Do you
know how many metal concerts I've missed - because of this war? - How many? Mm,
like one.
Do you know how much blogging I haven't been able to do?! I don't, but this is
all my fault! If only my taste buds weren't so adventurous.
But I promise to find a way to work this out! How? There's no end in sight to
all this fighting.
Hmm.
We need to stop this hate with some sort of opposite of hate.
- [Gasps.]
Ronaldo! - Hmm? - Kiki! - Hmm? You're sitting next to each other.
Where are you going with this, Steven? You guys should pretend to be in love!
There won't be any time for fighting if your families have to plan a wedding
together! Well I guess we could try? Anything to get this war over with.
All right! We'll fight this war with the power of love! No way! We can't do
this because I have a girlfriend.
- Where's she at, though? - You said what I was thinking.
Okay, you don't have to pretend to get married.
Just pretend to be in love long enough to get this feud over with.
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Shut up, Ronaldo! Nothing bad is going to happen, and you'll get to spend
time with the cutest girl in Beach City.
[Sputters.]
[Giggles.]
- Ah, Kiki, my darling! - Oh, Ronaldo, my sweet! My dear, sweet Kiki, who I
love with all my blog.
- What the - [Giggles.]
Oh, Ronaldo, you're so sweet and quirky in a way I can tolerate.
Kiki, why aren't you in here, working your shift?! Yeah, come on, Ronaldo.
We got customers to take care of.
But, Dad, ever since this war started, I've had to spend countless hours away
from my beloved Kiki.
Both: What?! It's true.
The only way for us to be together is if we quit working! Are you telling me
that you two are involved in a romantic relationship?! That's right, Steven.
We have been for some time now.
Mm-hmm! You two are only hugging, right? Uh, yes, sir! Just hugs and longing
looks! [Chuckling nervously.]
- Well, Kofi, love is a beautiful thing.
- Yes, love is beautiful.
We must end this feud in order for this love to blossom.
Yeah! The restaurant war is officially over! Ronaldo? [Wind whistling.]
I come all this way to return your "Koala Princess" DVDs, only to find you with
another girl? Both: Wha-a-a-a-a-t?! Jane, my sweet, this was all just a trick
to get my dad to stop selling mozzarella sticks! Save it for your blog Keep
Beach City Single! Jane, my ohime sama! Ohh! The deal is off! Fine by me!
Peedee, fire up those fryers! Kiki, pick up the phone! [All sigh.]
[Crying.]
Jane! Ugh, what are we gonna do?! Mm Peedee said the last time the war ended
because your dad and his dad came together to sign a treaty.
How did that happen? Well, you know where Suitcase Sam's is? It used to be a
restaurant called The Everything Buffet.
Oh, yeah! They sold everything! But it wrecked the boardwalk's economy! Not one
store could compete.
But just when everyone thought all hope was lost, our dad and Fryman teamed up
and ran them out of town.
Hmm.
Another restaurant, eh? I think I have a plan.
Welcome to the grand opening of Steven's.
Right this way.
La, la-la, la, la, la [Romantic music.]
Hmm, nice ambiance.
[Clears throat.]
It's all right.
There are not enough tables! There are just enough tables, Daddy.
La, la-la, la, la, la Hello, gentlemen.
May I take your order? I'm full of sadness! [Crying.]
- I will have the Fantastic Fries.
- Order taken.
I bet they're not as fantastic as ours.
And for you? I will have the Pizza Bagel! I doubt a Pizza Bagel can beat pizza
that isn't on a bagel.
[Chuckles.]
Ah, let's see.
Wonderful two of our best dishes.
Our only dishes? Amethyst, order up! Fire one fry and one pizza! [Claps.]
Yes, Chef! [Claps.]
[Music.]
[Twinkle!.]
Pearl: Here's your order, sir.
[Scoffs.]
Pizza on a bagel, indeed! And for you, sir.
Uh, can I get some ketchup? Sorry, no additions or substitutions.
[Chuckles.]
This place is all talk.
You can't have fries without ketchup.
[Munches.]
[Zing!.]
The ketchup is inside the fries?! Heh.
There's cream cheese in this pizza bagel it adds a whole other level of flavor!
And with pizza on a bagel, you can eat pizza anytime! - It's amazing! - It's
genius! Mm-hmm! Hmm.
Ah, gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed your meal.
Is there something I can help you with? Steven, we didn't want to have to do
this, but - Please, shut this place down! - What's this? You want me to close
my lovely establishment? Steven, we're begging you! We can't compete with a
place like this! - You'll drive us out of business! - There's already a line!
I'll close up shop under one condition.
Both: Anything! Stop this foolish war! Cook for yourselves and the good of the
boardwalk! No more cooking out of hate and spite! - Let's just do what we do
best! - Agreed! [Cheers and applause.]
Good job, Daddy.
Do you hear that, Ronaldo? The war's over! [Crying.]
Glad that's settled.
- Y'all help me clean this place up.
- Sorry.
We on break.
[Claps.]
[Pop!.]
Look at you go I just adore you I wish that I knew What makes you think I'm so
special

[Humming.]
[Sips.]
Mm-hmm.
Some mood lighting.
Some classy decor.
There! Mwah! This is so nice! [Knock on door.]
[Gasps.]
Pizza time! [Panting.]
[Grunts.]
- Kiki! - Ha ha! Hey, Steven! Cheddar cheese crust with double pepperoni? Oh,
thanks! But doesn't Jenny usually do deliveries? I had to take double duty
today because Jenny busted the pizza car.
- What?! - [Sighs.]
Yeah.
Who knew blasting one of Sour Cream's mix tapes could blow out the tires? -
Well, his drops are pretty dirty.
- Guess so.
Anyways, it means I've got to deliver all these orders by foot while Jenny
takes the car to the shop.
Oh? Looks fancy! You having anybody cute over, Steven? You mean, besides me?
[Chuckles nervously.]
I'm taking some "me" time.
You want in? Thanks, Steven, but I still have to run around town and deliver
all these pizzas.
There's a lot of other people having "me" time tonight.
But it's all right, I love running! Anyways, got to get back to it! Later,
Steven! See ya! [Panting.]
Poor Kiki.
Pizza time! [Music.]
Whoo! [Snoring.]
Yeah, whoo! Oh! Oh! Oh! [Laughing.]
Whoo-hoo! [Laughing.]
Those initials are looking pretty slick, Steven.
Whoa! Cool! A pizza dream! Hey, look! It's cheese me! [Laughing.]
Oh, gross! [Screams.]
Ew, ew! [Coughing.]
- Kiki?! Are you all right? - My leg! [Grunting.]
[Screams.]
[Grunting.]
What was that thing?! - Keep going! It won't give up! - Wha?! - I'll take care
of this! - Steven, be careful! Don't worry about me! Anything is possible when
you have rockets for bones! Steven, that was so brave! Well, it's cheddar than
nothing! Oh, hey, Dog-copter.
[Meows.]
See ya, dream Kiki! Oh, okay.
See you, dream Steven! [Laughing.]
Dream Steven! Man, I can't wait to tell Kiki about my weird Please, Kiki, just
one more time? I seriously can't miss this show.
It's Uber Rage's first concert back in the States since they got banned! Jenny,
I'm not sure.
I've covered for you for almost two weeks now! Kiki, seriously, this concert is
gonna change my life! And the ticket was, like, $40! - Is that a lot for a
concert? - It's more than average? - Okay, I'll cover you.
- Yes! That's why you're my favorite twin! I'm your only twin.
Mwah! I'll get you a shirt or something.
[Starts engine.]
Hey, Steven! Oh, and don't tell dad! That was really nice of you! Yep, that's
me the nice one.
I came here to tell you I had the craziest dream about you last night, Kiki! I
was flying around, and I pulled you out of an ocean of cheese! And then these
hands formed and came after you.
And then you saved me and flew off on a rocket dog? - "Dream Kiki" was you? -
"Dream Steven" was you?! I'm I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to go into your mind,
I - No, this is great! - You're not mad? Steven, I always have that dream, and
I always drown! I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks! You're my total
hero, Steven.
Can you do it again? Oh Of course! I'd really love to help! Thank goodness!
Because I seriously have that dream, like, every single night.
[Telephone rings.]
Oh, I got to go! Seriously, Steven, thank you so much! - See you later! - "In
your dreams!" [Laughs.]
Nice! I'm a dream warrior! [Snoring.]
[Music.]
[Screams.]
Hey, Kiki! It's time to cut the cheese! Hyah! Wow! Dream warrior! Dream
warrior! Prepare yourself for my grate-est technique yet! Hyah! Whoa! Dream
warrior.
Dream warrior Dream warrior Aah! Here I come.
[Yawns.]
Hey, Kiki.
[Chewing.]
[Snoring.]
[Groans.]
- Huh? - KIKI: Steven? Kiki? [Chuckles.]
You're upside down! Did you sleep okay? [Yawns.]
Yeah, like a baby.
What's happening? - Here.
- Pizza? For breakfast? It's 3:00.
Oh.
More of a late-afternoon lunch.
[Chomp.]
Delicious [Screams.]
Steven? - Kiki, you got to quit your job! - What? I think you have a serious
problem with pizza.
I don't have a problem with pizza.
I don't know, Kiki, I think you do! I'm sorry.
I I didn't mean to yell.
No, it's okay.
I get it.
I've been asking too much of you.
I just wish these dreams would stop.
Maybe we've been going about this all wrong.
- What do you mean? - Hmm.
We've just been looking at the toppings of the problem.
We've got to track this back to the sauce! But after this, I can't help you
anymore, okay? I'm just too tired.
- I understand.
- All right.
Tonight, we end these nightmares once and for all! [Snoring.]
[Music.]
You ready, Steven? Time to cut the cheese.
Shing! Sorry for using the same pun twice.
That's not a pun, but I forgive you! [Gasps.]
Huh? We can't keep fighting off the cheese - it just won't stop! - You're
right! We got to find out where all this cheese is coming from! Oh! - [Gasps.]
Look! - Huh? STEVEN: Whoa! It's me? Now, that is nasty.
[Clicking like dolphin.]
Aah! Anchovies! And pepperanhas! Ahh.
That was close! [Man groaning.]
Who's that?! They sound like they're in pain! We got to find them! Jenny?
[Groaning.]
Kiki! I'm here, Jenny! Oh! Oh, no! I'll help you, Kiki! Wait, I think she's
trying to tell me something! - Kiki - What is it, Jenny? Thanks for delivering
all those pizzas for me.
Oh, it's okay.
I totally don't mind.
That's what twins are for.
Whoa! [Grunting.]
Kiki, you're lying! - What? - You totally do mind! Aaagh! It doesn't matter!
Yes, it does! Your feelings matter, just tell her "no.
" - Ugh, I I can't! - Why not? I I don't want to let her down! I'm her favorite
twin! When I said I couldn't help you anymore after this, - you understood! -
But this is different, she's my sister! That's right! And she cares about you,
too! Do you think she'd want to put you through this? No.
Does she even know this is happening to you? - No.
- You got to tell her! Hey, Kiki, I want to ask you something.
There's gonna be a really cool cheese rave in the pizza cave tonight.
I have to be there.
Will you cover for me again? No! [Groans.]
Okay, fine.
[Music.]
You did it! Yeah! All the cheese is gone! Well, most of it.
- Man, dreams are weird.
- Yeah.
[Yawns.]
They sure are.
[Seagulls squawking.]
- Hi, Jenny.
- Oh, hey, Steven.
Is Kiki around? I wanted to see if she's doing okay.
[Yawns.]
I just spent all night helping her fight her inner cheese demons.
I don't know what that means, but Kiki is fine.
She's taking the day off.
This morning, we had a twin talk.
She said I was using up all her "me" time, and I was like, if you're just gonna
spend your "me" time running anyway, you might as well carry some pizzas for
me.
But I can't say no to my favorite twin.
So where is she? [Music.]
[Sighs.]
She deserves a break after working so hard for me.
Right, Steven? [Snoring.]
Steven? Look at you go I just adore you I wish that I knew What makes You think
I'm so special

Bear Bear, you've got a tear tear! I should have been more careful.
We've lost too many good bears.
Don't worry.
You're hurt, but I'll look after you.
Mwah! [Gasps.]
- Guys? Guys?! - What's up, little Ste-cup? We were just about to put away the
dishes.
Look what I can do! All right! It's a Ste-party! What is the meaning of this?!
My healing spit is back! I fixed a rip on MC Bear Bear! Here, I'll show! Fine,
fine, I believe you! I don't want you touching a broken plate.
- I'll find a broom.
- I'll find some other stuff to break! No, Amethyst! Now that my healing spit
is back - maybe I could finally - No.
What? But I didn't even ask anything yet.
With my future vision, I can see you're going to ask if you could use your
power to heal one of the monsters in the bubble room.
Can you see if I'll get you to change your mind? Mmm? [Bubbling.]
- Why did you agree to this? - I lost a battle of will.
Here it is! [Grunts.]
Gotcha! - Is that - It's Centipeetle.
If I can help any of them, I want to help her first.
[Grunts.]
Don't forget these! [Gasps.]
Chaaaps! They're her favorite.
Okay.
You guys ready? [Growling.]
Come on, dude, do your thing! Be careful! [Screeching.]
[Grunts.]
[Gasps.]
[All gasp.]
Is it working? [Gasps.]
[Screeches.]
It worked! Uh, Steven Centi, you're back! [Hisses.]
Whoa! What's the matter? Don't you want some Chaaaps? [Screeching.]
I don't think she remembers them.
Forget the Chaaaps.
You remember me, don't you? I have a bad feeling this didn't work how I wanted
it to work.
Hmm.
Possibly not.
Oh! Don't go closer! Maybe she just needs a little extra love! Mwah!
[Squawking.]
[Screeches.]
Uh, oops! [Chuckles.]
Hmm.
This is the best we've ever seen it work.
But it didn't work.
I guess it'll take more than a kiss to heal damage from the diamonds.
But why? My healing powers are back! I-I should be able to do this! It's all
right, Steven.
Remember, she's not cracked, she's corrupted and that's something different,
something nearly impossible to describe! It's sort of like if MC Bear Bear
didn't tear the fabric of his arm, but the fabric of his mind.
Sounds pretty explained to me! Hmm.
Steven, I'm impressed with your ability to bring the Centipeetle this far, but
it's time to let her rest again.
Amethyst UhSure.
I'll poof her.
[Chitters softly.]
But she's not a monster anymore! Here.
[Whimpers.]
You don't have to watch.
No, please! She can walk, and talk just like you guys! [Squawks.]
See? I helped her this much, maybe I can help her more! I have to try.
I made a promise! Pleeeeeease! [All sigh.]
What are we going to do with her? Let her move in? Aw, yeah! Corrupted
roommate! Oh, Amethyst, be sensitive! [Gasps.]
She can even stay in my room! Uh, we're really doing this? She can stay
unbubbled.
But you have to understand, some gems are beyond our help.
Okay, Centi Oh, I guess that's not really your name.
What is your name? [Squawks.]
Gurgle click-click? Oh, right.
Can't talk, huh? You really don't remember me? You don't remember saving me
from that seagull, or our adventure in the ice caves, or when I electrocuted
you with Uh, actually, do forget that one.
[Sigh.]
You even forgot Chaaaps.
[Sighs.]
[Squawks.]
I love chips.
[Imitates Steven's cadence.]
[Gasps.]
Do Do you remember me singing the Chaaaps jingle? [Squawks.]
# You love chips! # [Squawking in rhythm.]
# And I love chips # We love chips from Chaaaps! Your memories are still in
there! I just have to draw them out! Ooh, I know how we can talk, even if your
voice is messed up! [Squawks.]
See, this is an Earth crayon! I-I bet you gems are used to super-advanced space
crayons, but we make do.
Look! Steven.
That's me! Can you do that? [Squawks.]
Ahh, Steven, you're a genius! [Squawks.]
Okay, maybe not.
That's all right.
I have another plan! We'll just talk through the language of art! [Grunts.]
What are you adding? [Gasps.]
You remember, we were buds! Yeahhh! Do you remember anything from before y I I
mean, from long ago? Hmm.
[Squawks.]
It's you in some kind of spaceship? Is that how you came to Earth? What are you
drawing now? Huh.
They look kind of like you.
Was that your crew? Awhk! [Gasps.]
You were a captain? That's so cool! I'm sorry, that's so cool, sir! Oh, yeah,
you guys don't salute like that.
You go like Mm.
Ow, ow! Oh, this looked so easy when Peridot did it.
[Gasps.]
Yeah! Like that! Awhk! It's you saluting You're saluting someone Your
commander? She gave you an order You and your crew and your ship Whoa lots of
ships.
You flew through space towards Earth.
You landed and started building stuff! But then the gem war.
You joined the fight [Imitating explosions.]
You and your crew kept going.
You got separated.
But you were still fighting.
Then new orders from your commander to retreat.
Everyone's running, but from what? You don't know.
Where's your crew? Where's your ship?! You stopped.
You heard something? From the sky, a sound a song? And then [Sobbing.]
Centi? [Crying.]
That light, where did that come from? [Groaning.]
Damage from the diamonds.
[Loud cough.]
Are you okay?! [Screeching.]
You're reverting.
[Screeching.]
Here, I'll heal you again! [Grunting.]
Why isn't it working?! How can I help you?! [Screeching.]
I don't understand! Awhk! [Grunting.]
It's not working 'cause you're corrupted.
Where do you want to go? Uh, the battlefield? Your ship? [Squawks.]
Is there something on the ship that can help you? [Groans.]
Just hold on! I'll get you there! Awhk! Hey! Wait for Steven! [Panting.]
[Squawks.]
[Screeching.]
[Screeching.]
Oh, no! Where are you trying to get to? [Snarling.]
You want in the door! Steven Universe, at your service-erse! [Grunting.]
[Screeching.]
We're in! What now? Other Centipeetles? [Chirping.]
[Screeches.]
[Chirping.]
Hey, now! This is my style! Ha! [Squawking.]
Can I hang with you, dudes? Amethyst, don't make fun! I'm not! Ugh! You guys
were right after all.
I couldn't help Centipeetle.
You brought the Centipeetle back to her ship.
You brought her back to her crew.
They've been waiting here for her.
They didn't want to leave her behind.
Wait, how did you know any of that? She told us.
Her drawings? Her writing.
It's actually decently legible! Wow! [Chirping.]
[Laughs.]
You look so happy here.
Can we let the Centipeetles stay? You can put those puppy dog eyes away,
Steven.
This ship is their bubble now.
[Chirps.]
Pearl! Pearl, Pearl! Will you teach me to write in gem? Oh, Steven, it's very
complicated.
And you won't have much use for it.
Oh, just a few things, like, "Hi, how are you? Where's the bathroom?" And "I'm
sorry.
" Look at you go I just adore you I wish that I knew What makes You think I'm
so special

Sea
****** Steven Universe (2013) s03e15 Episode Script ******
**** Alone at Sea ****
1 I'm starting to guess the surprise, Steven.
I told you to close your eyes! [Laughs.]
Sorry.
Okay, wait here! Both: Surprise! [Bubble pipe buzzes.]
Hm.
We bought a boat! Uh, correction we rented a boat.
I may be rich, but buying a boat would be going a bit overboard.
Ayyy.
Ayyyyy.
Both: Ayyyyy! Just a joke I picked up from some sailors.
They have a surprisingly clean sense of humor.
Steven, who is this? Uh, Greg Universe.
You broke my leg trying to use the ocean to fly back to your homeworld.
Lapis Lazuli.
Nice to meet you.
Great! Well, I'll get the boat started.
So what do you think? It's nice, Steven but I don't know.
Look, Lapis, I know you spent a really long time fused with Jasper at the
bottom of the ocean, but you're not Malachite anymore.
And water is a part of who you are.
You can't let one bad experience take that away from you.
It was more than one.
Just give it a chance.
I promise we'll make this the most fun you've ever had.
Steven, I don't deserve this.
Of course you do! We even named her Li'l Lappy.
[Snorts, laughs.]
Okay.
I'll give it a chance.
But, just one.
Whoa! [Laughs.]
You two ready to set sail? Aye, aye, Captain! Yes.
[Horn honks.]
Full speed ahe Whoa! [Crash.]
Ah, geez, you think anyone will notice? Wow, I think I did a number on that
dock.
Maybe somebody else should take a shot at being captain.
What do you say, Captain Lazuli? I shouldn't.
Go for it, Lapis.
Don't put me in charge! Oh, sorry.
I mean, y-you shouldn't trust me with the boat.
Uh, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.
We can all be first mates so there's no pressure.
Only fun stuff today! Lapis, you can still wear the hat, if you want.
Thanks, but I'm not putting that on my body.
Let's set a course for f-u-u-un! [Upbeat music plays.]
[Horn honks.]
[Both laugh.]
[Horn honking.]
[Chuckles, groans.]
Dad! Dad! Hey, you two.
Finally get enough of that horn? What?! [Chuckles.]
What are you doing? Catching fish.
Oh, I can help! [Sighs.]
[Gasps.]
What the?! Whoa.
That's a pretty uh fancy way of catching fish.
That's 'cause Lapis is supa' strong! Well, I, uh, appreciate the gesture, but
I-I think it would be safer to stick to the old-fashioned way of doing it.
Oh, uh sure.
Both: Whoa! [Boat creaks.]
Wow, Lapis! That was ama zing So, how do you fish the old-fashioned way? Oh,
it's pretty simple.
You start with a rod, and you put a hook on the end of your line.
And then, when you feel a nibble, you reel it in.
And there it is.
You've caught yourself a fish to eat! But why would a fish ever bite a hook?
You got to bait it put something on it you know it wants, like a worm or a $20
bill.
Here, I'll show you.
Fishing.
[Thump.]
When does the fish part happen? Well, sometimes it isn't about the fish you
keep, but the company you catch.
Whoa! I got a bite.
[Gasps.]
Lapis, here! Give it a try! Hold it just like that and reel it in slowly.
Like this? [Reel clicking.]
You got it.
It looks like a big one! [Reel clicks, zips.]
Whoa! Lapis! Steven! [Grunts.]
You got it, Lapis! Reel it in! [Straining.]
It's pulling so hard! [Gasps.]
[Sighs.]
Looks like this pole rental turned into a pole purchase.
But you did a great job tangling with that beast.
Y-Yeah.
Don't worry about that one getting away.
Oh, thank you.
Welp, that's my adventure quota for the day.
I'll be at the controls.
Holler if you need me.
Yes, sir! Lapis, what do you Lapis? Hey.
Whatcha doing? I just thought I'd sit for a bit.
You looked like a real pro fisher before the pole snapped.
Thanks.
Hmm.
So, fishing was a bust.
But I-I got something that'll cheer you up.
Shuffleboard! What do you say? [Crash.]
Aah! Ugh! [Groans.]
What was that? [Crash.]
Aah! Are you okay? Yeah.
What's going on? Greg: Steven! You got a moment? Is everything okay, First Mate
Dad? Shh! You hear that? Uhhh no.
I guess it stopped.
I think something's wrong with the boat.
[Wheel clicks.]
Aw, geez, something's throwing off the rudder.
I don't know what's going on, and this owner's manual is no help.
It's mostly advice on sun tanning and what crackers go with caviar.
Well, what crackers go with caviar? Water crackers.
Both: Ayyyyyyyyyyyy! [Muffled thumping.]
[Gasps.]
There it is.
[Rumbling.]
[Crash.]
[Both coughing.]
Oh, crud! The engine! I don't know how to fix an engine.
This trip might be a Little longer than we thought, little buddy.
Lapis? Um I have some not-so-good news.
There's trouble with the engine, and we might be stuck out here for a while.
[Sighs.]
[Sighs.]
I'm so sorry! This whole thing is my fault.
I just wanted you to have fun.
but e-everything's a mess.
I shouldn't have made you come on this trip.
It's my fault.
I'm the one to blame.
That's not true.
I'm really trying to enjoy it out here, but I can't stop thinking about being
fused as Malachite, how I used all my strength to hold her down in the ocean,
and how I was always battling against Jasper to keep her bound to me.
But it's not like that anymore.
You don't have to be with Jasper.
That's not it.
I I miss her.
What?! [Sighs.]
We were fused for so long.
But she's terrible.
I'm terrible! I did horrible things! I-I broke your dad's leg.
I stole Earth's ocean! Go on! Tell me I'm wrong! [Rumble, boat creaks.]
[Rumble.]
Whoa! [Chain clanking, clacking.]
[Gasps.]
Finally! [Thunder crashes.]
Both: Jasper! I thought I'd never catch up to you! You've been following us?
I've been following you.
[Gasps.]
Stay back! [Laughs.]
This dulled-down version of Rose Quartz works for you now? You're pointing that
shield the wrong way.
[chuckles.]
She's the one you should be afraid of.
That's not true.
You can't lie to me.
I've seen what you're capable of.
I thought I was a brute, but you you're a monster.
I Lapis doesn't want anything to do with you! This is between us! [Groans.]
Steven! [Grunts.]
Let's be Malachite again.
[Thunder crashes.]
Why would you want that? I was wrong about fusion.
You made me understand! Malachite was bigger and stronger than both of us! We
could fly! Lapis, don't listen to her! - Stay out of this! - I was terrible to
you.
I liked taking everything out on you.
I needed to.
I-I hated you.
It was bad! It'll be better this time.
I've changed.
You've changed me.
I'm the only one who can handle your kind of power.
[Gasps.]
Together, we'll be unstoppable! No.
What? What we had wasn't healthy.
I never want to feel like I felt with you never again! So just go.
Lapis! She said, "No"! Leave her alone! This is your fault.
[Growls.]
I'll shatter you! [Gasps.]
[Gasps.]
[Grunts.]
Lapis, you did it! Are you two okay?! What?! [Boat creaking, groaning.]
What happened? Uh, it's kind of a long story.
I guess I bought a boat after all.
Ehh, sorry, Dad.
But, hey, the ocean's really beautiful from up here.
Yeah.
It is.
If I could begin to do Something that does right by you I would do about
anything I would even learn how to love

good.
How's baby life? How does it look? Hard.
Mind if I bum around here for the day? No more than usual.

I think.
Trust me, you're not.
Okay, don't forget, diaper bag's over there, snacks are over there.
Emergency number's on the fridge.

So, how about it, Sour Cream, you ready to spend the day with your rad Unkie
Greg? Meh.
You really are Vidalia's son, aren't you? There you go.
Okay.
Baby Sour Cream, meet sun screen.
Oh, can't forget these! [Laughs.]
You're one cool baby! Rose: Hi, Greg! Hi, Rose.
Greg! Where did you get this mini human from? Oh, this is Sour Cream.
Did you make him? Wh-what? [Laughs.]
No.
I'm just babysitting for Vidalia.
Hi, Sour Cream.
I'm Rose.
Hey, let's show this baby how to beach it.
Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yee-haw! [Laughing.]
That feels great! Hey, Sour Cream, look at me.
[Laughs.]
I'm a sand man! [Laughs.]
[Spits.]
[Chuckles.]
I guess he just likes siting on this blanket.
You wouldn't believe how long it took me to figure out that this and you are
the same thing.
What do you mean? You're both human.
You have to admit, it's a little confusing.
Your big and can talk, and he's small and can only make noises.
How was I supposed to know you were the same species? [Laughs.]
What? I know, it's silly.
But then I started to notice that you grow.
Well, can't play guitar with little baby hands.
[Laughs.]
When a gem is made, it's for a reason.
They burst out of the ground already knowing what they're supposed to be, and
then that's what they are.
Forever.
But you, you're supposed to change.
You're never the same even moment to moment you're allowed and expected to
invent who you are.
What an incredible power the ability to "grow up.
" Wow.
Those would make some pretty good lyrics.
Hold on.
Watch Sour Cream a second.
I got to write this down! All right, what were you saying? Something really
profound, yet relatable? [Guitar thuds, twangs.]
Oh, my gosh! Vidalia is gonna destroy me! Sour Cream! Rose! Where are you
guys?! [Panting.]
Rose! [Seagull screeches.]
Hyah! Sour cream?! Are y'all up there?! Sour Cream! Rose cream! Rose?! Greg.
Rose! Wow, you look tired.
Thank goodness I found the both Where's Sour Cream?! I thought you were gonna
watch him for me! Oh, I watched him.
I watched him climb all the way up there.
[Screams.]
Isn't this exciting? This'll be a formative experience for him.
Well, not if he falls! Come on! Okay.
I'll try and get him down.
[Grunting.]
Phew.
[Grunts.]
Hey, Baby Cream, stay right there.
Whew.
How can you be so calm right now? Uh How do I get Mmmmmmmmm! Rose! Help me out!
Are those the controls over there? Right, yes.
Hold on.
I think you got to pull one of those levers! This one? Whoa! It's, uh, going a
little too fast.
Hold on, Sour Cream.
[Grunts.]
Whoa! Rose, get me off this crazy thing! Ugh! Leave Greg alone! [Screaming.]
[Growling.]
No-o-o-o-o-o! Greg! [Growls.]
Hup! Aaaah! Oof! Greg.
Sour Cream! Whew! He's safe.
[Grunts.]
Why did you let him climb that thing? He wanted to.
Well, Rose, you can't just let him do whatever he wants.
But you do whatever you want, and you're fine.
Yeah, but I'm not a baby.
I don't need someone to feed me or change my clothes.
I don't need someone to save me when I climb on to a Ferris wheel and Oh, man.
I am a baby.
Do you want to get down? Yeah.
Aw, look at you.
Did you have fun with Greg, Sour Cream? Oh, yeah.
Nothing but safe wholesome fun with Unkie Greg.
[Chuckles.]
Listen, Vidalia, um, thanks for the food and everything else.
Today has been quite a journey.
Okay? Your shirt's clean.
You want it back, or are you just gonna go for a topless stroll? Hey, we all
got to grow up sometime, right? That's not really relevant to my question.
[Humming.]
I know I'm not that tall I know I'm not that smart Let me drive my van into
your wash Let me drive my van into your wash Wow.
And you've worked here ever since.
That's right.
You know, people grow, whether they want to or not.
But growing up is something you got to decide to do.
Hey, what ever happened to Baby Sour Cream? No one knows.
Meh.
If I could begin to do Something that does right by you I would do about
anything I would even learn how to love

Wow! The great north is so beautiful in person.
Wait, wait, stay right there! All right, smile! [Shutter clicks.]
Okay, now one where it looks like you're looking for a monster! [Clicks.]
Okay, now one like you made a joke! [Clicks.]
Okay, now, do one where the joke's not that funny, but it's more like a joke
that makes you think.
Okay, I think that's enough photography.
But it's Connie's first mission! Her parents asked me to take lots of pictures.
Uh Thank you so much for letting me come on this mission, Pearl.
It's such an honor to work alongside you.
Well, Connie, your sword-fighting skills have far exceeded my expectations.
And, with my careful supervision, of course, I'm confident that you can handle
a simple gem-recovery mission like this.
Thank you so much! I promise I won't let you down, ma'am! [Clicks.]
Connie's first mission! [Music.]
Recap the mission for us, Connie.
Garnet sensed some corrupted gem activity in these woods.
It is our job to locate it, destabilize its form and bubble it.
Very good.
Now, your human bodies aren't designed to last in this cold, so we'll have to
be extra careful.
That's okay.
I've got this backpack filled with everything we need to survive in the
wilderness.
And I brought board games in case we get bored.
Ah, yes.
Very good.
So, how will we know if this corrupted gem is nearby? [Growling.]
[All gasp.]
That's how! Here it comes! [Growls.]
[Roars.]
[Shutter clicks.]
Remember, you work together! - Ready, Connie? - Ready, Steven! [Roars.]
Two of them?! [Snarling and grunting.]
Steven, bubble! Bubble power! Theyran away? There weren't supposed to be two.
Oh, oh I have an idea! We could split up! You can go after one of them, Pearl,
and Steven and I will go after the other one.
Connie, you are my pupil, so I know your combat skills are excellent.
But I'm afraid this is too risky.
You've never been in a real fight before.
Well, that's not true.
Connie defeated those gem experiments at the hospital.
But [Echoing.]
And look! I brought these walkie-talkies so we can talk to each other in case
something happens! [Walkie beeps.]
But And I've read this book front to back, at least 20 times! [Sighs.]
Well, all right.
But as soon as you find the monster, contact me immediately.
I don't want you fighting this thing alone.
One more time, what are you looking for? Both: A monster.
What do you do when you find it? Call you.
And who's your favorite gem? [Disapproving.]
Pearl! Why, thank you! [Laughter.]
Now, be safe! Both: Yes, ma'am! [Music.]
All we have to do is follow these tracks.
Yeah.
These are fresh.
We trail it until it stops to rest.
Wow, Connie, you're a wilderness expert.
Well, I like to be prepared.
When civilization collapses and this world ends, I need to be ready to build
the new one.
Yeah, I guess if homeworld invades Earth, things could get pretty crazy for
humanity.
Forget gems.
Humans are already starting their own demise! Peak oil, Steven! How do we
handle terminal decline without alternate energy sources?! [Walkie beeps.]
Pearl: How are you two doing? Are you hungry? Remember, you humans need to eat!
Both: Yes, ma'am! Luckily, I packed plenty of survival fuel.
Time to get our protein on! [Chomp!.]
[Chomp!.]
Good thing this snow is here it makes following tracks a lot easier.
I'll say! So, these corrupted gems are like wild animals.
Just a bundle of fight or flight reflexes and survival instincts.
Well, they're like that now, but before they were different.
They used to be normal gems like Pearl, Amethyst, and Garnet.
They had thoughts and feelings, friends I don't really know how the corruption
works.
It's like they're sick.
They don't remember who they used to be.
Maybe they don't even know how to look like themselves anymore.
- Whoa.
You okay? - Yeah, I'm good.
Oh, I know what'll cheer me up! Whoo-hoo! [Grunts.]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oof! [Mumbling.]
[Walkie beeps.]
Pearl: Steven, Connie? I'm not having any luck finding this monster.
We might have to return to the temple and regroup.
No, no! We can handle it! We're making great progress.
We can definitely take care of this ourselves! Oh, well, you sound very
confident.
Carry on then, and remember, Connie Stance wide, body lowered.
I've got it, ma'am.
Balance is the key [Walkie beeps.]
- Need some help there? - Yes, please.
[Grunts.]
[Laughter.]
Whoa.
Look at the tracks.
Whoa.
Now, this is a mess.
Some of these prints look humanoid.
Could Pearl have been here? But Pearl went the other direction.
[Shutter clicks.]
Monster humanoid monster.
What could this mean? We should probably take shelter from this blizzard.
But first, let's grab some of these pine needles.
We can brew a vitamin-C-rich tea with them so we don't get scurvy.
Like a pirate.
The tea's ready! Here, try it! Thanks! [Slurps.]
- How is it? - It's Hmm.
- It's bad.
- Well, yeah.
It's not about tasting good, Steven, it's about surviving the punishment of
nature.
[Slurping.]
So, why were there humanoid tracks out there? They weren't ours, and they
weren't Pearl's.
It couldn't have been the monster.
Unless it's just some guy in a monster suit.
But that kind of thing only happens in cartoons, usually over a property
dispute.
Maybe it is a guy in a monster costume.
- You think so? - I don't mean literally, silly.
What I mean is there might be a conscious gem - still inside there somewhere.
- Is that possible? What if the monster is turning back and forth into its
original form.
If it is, it might not be as corrupted as we think.
There might still be a chance to save it.
How? I can't heal gems that are corrupted at least not all the way.
But if it's half-corrupted [Snarling.]
[Both gasp.]
This way! [Both panting.]
- Ah! - Ow.
Shh! [Snarling.]
It seems scared.
Is it running from us? What if it's running from itself? Shh! Keep your voice
down! [Walkie beeps.]
Pearl: Hello, you two! How's it going? This weather has really taken a turn for
the worse, and I would hate to be responsible for putting you two in danger.
Make sure you bundle up with Steven! Turn it off! I'm trying! Oh! And,
remember, if you find the monster, don't make any loud, startling noises.
- Hello?! Anyone there?! - Stupid, slipper mittens.
I'm just going to keep talking until somebody answers.
[Grunts.]
Steven! [Snarling.]
Wait.
Let me try talking to it.
Hey.
How's it going? Um, can you hear me? Are you in there somewhere? You can
control this.
Remember who you used to be.
Steven, I don't think it's working.
[Roaring.]
[Both scream.]
[Grunting.]
Steven! Hey! Over here! Connie, what are you doing?! [Growling.]
I I don't know.
Iwasn't prepared for this.
[Walkie beeps.]
Pearl: Steven, Connie?! Is this because of the "favorite gem" thing? Heh, that
was just a joke! [Chuckles.]
- Don't tell Garnet.
- Connie! Pearl, we found the monster! - What?! - We need your help! I'll be
right there, Connie! [Gasps.]
Who's that?! B-B-B-B-B-B-Bubble! Aaah! [Grunting.]
[Gasps.]
[Roaring.]
[Poof!.]
- Jasper.
- Those footprints.
The monsters were running from her.
Connie, where's the Jasper! [Chuckles.]
Hey, Rose, look what I got.
[Shutter clicks.]
[Chuckles.]
- [Sighs.]
Are you two okay? - Yeah, we're fine.
Oh, thank goodness.
What a disaster.
I never would have let you come on this mission if I knew Jasper would be here.
- I'm sorry.
- What? I thought I'd be ready to fight, but I wasn't.
- I failed.
- You weren't supposed to fight.
You were supposed to call me, and you did.
- This was a total success.
- Connie's first mission! Connie's first mission! - Group picture.
- Steven! [Laughs.]
Oh.
Another picture? - Tell me when you [Shutter clicks.]
- Eh, got it.
Oh, no.
Are your parents going to see this? My parents see all of my photos, ma'am.
Pearl: Hmm.
If I could begin to do Something that does right by you I would do about
anything I would even learn how to love

****** Steven Universe (2013) s03e18 Episode Script ******
**** Crack the Whip ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #
- # Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # All right,
we may be a while.
- But - Amethyst! What? I'm busy.
Amethyst, hold down the fort.
Aye, aye, Captain.
No surprises while I'm on duty.
- [Door open.]
Wha! - Surprise! I'm early! I was trying to tell you Connie has sword training
today.
Oh! I completely forgot.
I'm so sorry, Connie.
[Clears throat.]
Very irresponsible, Pearl.
Mnh.
Is this because of Jasper? - Are you headed back north? - She's on the move.
We can't have her just out there, attacking random monsters for whatever
reason.
Of course.
Be safe.
- That's my line.
Amethyst? - Got it.
We'll train next week without Jasper hanging over our heads.
Best-case scenario.
Lucky break for you guys You get the training day off.
So, what do you want to do? [Both grunting.]
- Oh? Huh? - Hey, no fair.
[Laughs.]
Hey, Amethyst, did you see that? - Amethyst? - 'Sup? Are you even watching?
Sure.
What's it look like? Like you're not watching.
Oh, all right.
You got me.
[Laughs.]
Is that better? [Laughs.]
Ew! Gross.
Ew! Gross.
But, yeah, that's better.
Come on, Connie.
Let's take it from the top.
Okay! [Both grunting.]
Did you see that? Excellent! Amazing! Pearl-fect.
[Laughs.]
- Ohh.
I don't know.
- Not really.
My stance is all wrong, and my grip is a little soft.
What are you worried about that little stuff for? It's not gonna matter in a
real fight.
It does, though.
I blew it on my first real magical mission.
I was face-to-face with a monster, and I froze.
Maybe if I'd trained a little harder, I could have handled it.
Sounds to me like you're too in your own head.
[Scoffs.]
In a fight, you never know what's gonna happen.
You just got to go with it.
How can you get ready when you don't even know what you're getting ready for,
huh? Yeah, you can't be ready.
What you got to be is loose.
[Energy pulsating.]
I want to be loose! Then you got to go with the flow.
Fighting's all about that feeling deep in your guts.
What do your guts feel like?! [Stomach rumbles.]
Hungry.
[Laughs.]
Mine, too.
[Chanting.]
Snack break.
Snack break.
[Chanting continues.]
Well, we do need energy to practice.
[Chanting.]
Snack break! Snack break! Snack break! Snack break! [Humming.]
Who wants doughnuts? - I do! - Maybe just one! Great.
It's on me.
Like a burger [Door opens, chime sounds.]
Be right there! Welcome to the Big Donut.
How can I hel Wha-huh? Hey, donut girl.
It's me, donut boy.
You mind if I grab a couple of crullers? It's cool.
I totally work here.
- What the - Sorry, Sadie.
It's just Amethyst bein' Amethyst - by not bein' Amethyst.
- Eh, it's no problem, Steven.
It's just a couple of donuts.
[Chuckles.]
Okay, maybe it's a problem.
[Door opens, chime sounds.]
[Up-tempo music plays.]
[Song ends.]
Come on! Come on! [Chuckles.]
I didn't bring a swimsuit! In the heat of battle, you're not gonna have a
swimsuit, Connie.
By Jove, I guess you're right.
[Laughing.]
I don't think I've ever had this much fun in one day.
Bungakowa! We should spend more time with Amethyst.
She's the best! You're the best.
Nuh-uh, you're the best.
[Both laughing.]
[Rumbling.]
[Snarling.]
[Roars.]
[Sniffing.]
[Growling.]
Uhhh I remember you, too, buddy.
[Chuckles.]
[Growling.]
[Roars.]
[Yelps.]
[Grunting.]
Aah! Amethyst, that was amazing! Whoa! Are you okay? [Sighs.]
Not a pretty win, but I'll take it.
That was the monster we fought in the snow.
At least, it looked like it was.
I think you'd remember a face like that.
Well, there were two of them.
Two of them? [Roars.]
Rose.
Jasper! Glad I found you.
I've decided to build my own army.
Where's the rest of yours? - They're not here right now! - Shh! - So, it's just
you lot? - Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna whip your butt all by myself! [Growls.]
I got Jasper.
You guys handle that dope.
Okay, we get a second chance at this.
Just stay together.
[Roars.]
I came here to fight Rose, not some runt! You think you can just keep showing
up and picking fights with us?! Ha! Why don't you get a life?! Fighting is my
life! It's what I was made for.
It's what you were made for too, runt.
So? I've got other stuff goin' on.
I can fight just fine! Well, then, let's see it! [Chuckles.]
You're not even trying.
Is it because you know you're already a failure? You're a Quartz Soldier, just
like me.
But you're not like me, are you? [Growling.]
[Chuckles.]
You're small! Amethyst?! Are you that desperate for troops, Rose, that you keep
a defect like this?! Rose saidI'm perfect the way I am.
Then she had low standards.
[Growls.]
Youcould have been me! And what are you instead? Both: Amethyst! Just a joke.
[Both gasp.]
Come on! Time to get rid of this embarrassment.
Both: Hyah! [Both panting.]
You fused?! Whoa! I-I did.
You Crystal Gems would even fuse with a human?! I don't want to hear anything
you say unless it's, "Sorry.
" [Roars.]
[Growls.]
Oh, no, you don't.
[Yelps.]
Wait here.
I'll protect you.
Head-to-head, just like I like it.
Ready when you are.
[Growls.]
[Roars.]
Ha! Aaah! Steven, Connie, I'm back! Uh, everything's gonna be fi [Wind
rushing.]
Fusion! Fusion! It's always fusion! Are you ready to apologize? This was just a
warm-up.
Get ready for next time, Rose.
Jaspers don't give up! Jaspers keep going until we get what we want.
Hmm.
I guess she lives in the ocean now.
You guyswon? Amethyst! [Both grunt.]
You're back! You're okay! Thank goodness! Uh, thank you, guys.
[Chuckles.]
- Did you see us? - It was just like you said you were in trouble, and we just
had to fight! Everything we knew just came together.
- We fused! - We won! I can't wait to tell the others! [Both laugh.]
Oh, good.
You didn't need me at all.
If I could begin to do Something that does right by you I would do about
anything I would even learn how to love

**** Steven vs Amethyst ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #

[Sighs.]
- We're never going to find Jasper.
- Pearl, Garnet! - We found Jasper! - What?! - We beat her! - Oh, my gosh! Are
you all right?! What happened?! She showed up with those big snow monsters, so
we fought those.
But then things got really scary, so Connie and I fused! Stevonnie got to ride
lion and we chased Jasper away! All your training you did so well! [Chuckles.]
We're so proud of you.
Wait.
Where's Amethyst? Yo.
Amethyst? You reformed.
I'm fine.
[Garbage disposal whirring.]
I hope you're ready for your weekly training, Steven! I'm ready on the weekly!
You've had one victory, but there are more fights to come now that Jasper's
[Garbage disposal whirring.]
Now that Jasper's [Garbage disposal whirring.]
Jasper's back! Let's work hard! [Chuckles.]
Hey, Amethyst.
Yo.
You want to come watch me train? Can't.
I'm busy making egg salad.
Come on, it'll be fun! Mm You'll get to see me earn Pearl points.
What are Pearl points? I'm glad you asked! Pearl: Pearl points are awarded for
punctuality, perseverance, and positivity.
[Snickers.]
We may be smaller, weaker, and less gifted than our opponents, but with these
"P"s, we have the keys to success.
And to the Pearl prize pouch! Ha! P-amazing Thank you.
There's some P-great stuff in that pouch.
Last week, I got these! I don't even need glasses, so it's funny! Really,
Amethyst, the positive reinforcement has been doing wonders.
I want in.
On the glasses? On the training.
[Gasps.]
Really? You, Amethyst? Yeah.
You know, for fun.
All right! Yeah, yeah.
[Scoffs.]
You're welcome.
Well, then, let the training begin! Your first test will be speed.
[Yawns.]
To aid your training, I will be utilizing my holograms.
Welcome to Holo-Pearl version 2.
000001.
I've modified them to accommodate less lethal training.
The sharpest weapon is the mind.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
The Holo-Pearl will serve as a checkpoint at the edge of the arena.
Mark your lap with a Holo-Pearl high five.
High five accepted! Two laps, two fives.
One pearl point to the winner! Got it! Yerp.
Okay then, on your marks.
Ready steady go! [Both panting.]
High five accepted! [Laughing.]
Huh? High five accepted! Give me digits, Amethyst! High five accepted!
[Laughs.]
One point for Steven already! [Whispering.]
Good thinking, Amethyst.
Going easy on him will build his confidence! [Chuckles.]
What can I say, I'm a natural at going easy.
Pearl: Your next test is agility.
Dodge the spears the best you can.
Agh! [Grunting.]
Defeat accepted! Whoa.
Victory, victory! Don't go too easy on him.
He still needs a challenge.
And now, for your final test, an all-out battle.
This is the ultimate determination of your skills! Okay! Ready, go! Come and
get me, you holo-punks! [Grunting.]
Aah! Mm.
Stop moving so I can win! Thanks.
Wah! [Grunts.]
Boomerang shield! - Defeat accepted! - Defeat accepted! - Defeat accepted! -
Defeat accepted! Victory accepted! Congratulations, Steven! You earn the final
point! It's time for you to pick a prize from the prize pouch! Man: Lonely
Blade versus Outgoing Fist.
Round 1 fight! Flying punch! Boomerang, boomerang, boomerang blade! [Screams.]
K.
O.
Even my fists are dead! [Gulp.]
Hey, Amethyst, do you want to play "Lonely Blade" with me? I warmed up the
controller for you.
[Sighs.]
Yeah, all right.
[Music.]
There's a new costume for Lonely Blade Blue Lonely Blade! You should play as
him! Whatevie.
Lonely Blade versus Lonely Blade! My blade is the best in all the land.
Round 1 fight! Boomerang, blade! Boomerang, blade! Ugh, this is tough.
Were those bars always there? The health bars? Yeah.
Right, right [Grunting.]
Ugh! You're doing so well! I've been trying to master that combo for months! -
You got it in, like, one try! - Hmm.
[Grunts.]
Oh, man! There's no way I could beat you! 1,000 mirror blade! Hyah! K.
O.
! My blade is the loneliest after all.
That was crazy good, Amethyst.
Nice job! Knock it off Steven, I know you let me win.
What, me? No! I [Scoffs.]
No.
You weren't even trying.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted you to feel better.
Great.
And now you're even more mature than me.
Amethyst? You're supposed to be the rookie, but now you're better than me at
everything.
[Sighs.]
Now I'm the worst crystal gem.
W-What? Ugh! You know what I mean, Steven.
Uh, not really! I thought you guys wanted me to be strong.
And now I am, and you're mad at me?! No! I get mad at myself! That's, ugh, the
thing I do.
I get mad at myself, and then it makes me suck at everything I do even more!
[Sighs.]
Amethyst, you don't suck.
You do so many cool things.
You have two whips two whips! And the dash thing?! Amethyst, you're so much
better than me.
No way.
You have Rose's shield.
And Bubble! And the floating thing! And, ugh, I'd just be floating all day!
Floating? I forget to use that half the time! And the rest of the time, my
powers aren't even guaranteed to work! I'm I'm way worse than you.
Nuh-uh.
I'm the worst! No way! I am! I'll prove it! I'll I'll fight you, and show you
how bad I am! Fine! Let's do it! Both: Let the worst gem lose! Get ready, I'm
about to lose big time! No way! I'm gonna get clobbered so bad I won't know
what hit me! No holding back? No holding back! [Growls.]
[Grunts.]
[Coughing.]
What?! Ooh-wah! [Grunts.]
Whoa! I did not see that coming! That was amazing! No, it's not! I don't do
anything amazing! [Grunts.]
[Groans.]
You're the one who's amazing! [Grunting.]
Whoa! [Groans.]
What?! Is that new? [Gasps.]
Because it's awesome! No, it was an accident! Accidents are not awesome! Sure.
Right! [Growls.]
[Yelling.]
Huh? What?! Don't save Whoa! [Growls.]
That was great! You think that was on purpose? [Panting.]
[Growls.]
Guess who remembered to floa Whoa! [Gasps.]
[Sighs.]
[Sighs.]
Whoa! [Panting.]
Steven? [Growls.]
See?! I dropped you from the sky, but you almost just won using a rock! Huh! If
I can't beat you, I'm never going to beat Jasper! You! You can totally beat me!
You're not even trying! I am, too! [Grunting.]
[Panting.]
Huh?! [Yells.]
I think we're both too good at being bad fighters.
That's what you think! What does that even mean? I don't even know! [Both
yelling.]
Ha [Laughs.]
[Both laughing.]
What's wrong with us?! Well, I know what's wrong with me.
I'm not supposed to be small, and everyone's always acting like there's no
problem.
"You can be anything you want to be.
" No, I can't! [Sighs.]
I can't even be the one thing I'm supposed to be, ya know? Of course I do.
I'm not Rose Quartz.
Oh, no.
Oh, Steven.
Why do you think I've been working so hard? Well, it's paying off.
[Laughs.]
I sure hope so! [Grunts.]
[Giggling.]
[Grunts.]
[Both laughing.]
Thanks, Steven.
Aah! What did you two do? You've ruined the ruins! - Whoops.
- I don't think we're gonna see that prize pouch for a while.
If I could begin to do Something that does right by you I would do about
anything I would even learn how to love

- No, no.
Jump, ju mp! - Oh! - Blehh! Dying a bunch in a video games is emotionally
exhausting.
Huh? [Growling.]
Lion! [Growling.]
Drop it! Agh! Lion, you can't chew this up.
How else am I going to remember the time I rode the Thunder Bird at Funland?
Okay, I'm sure this time [Munching.]
Lion! Don't even think about it.
[Grunts.]
Since you can't play nice, I'm gonna have to put this where you can't get it:
in your mane.
[Snort.]
Thank you, boo.
[Shimmer!.]
[Tranquil tune plays.]
[echoing.]
There we go.
Now, it'll be safe forever, hanging in this perfectly stable, magic tree.
Ohhhhh! Agh! Hmm? [muffled.]
Ahhhhh! - Jump, jump.
- I am jumping.
[Shimmer!.]
- I made a horrible mistake! - What?! Aw, man.
Hold on.
I can fix it.
[Shimmer!.]
[Resonating.]
Agh! [Grunting.]
[Resonating.]
[Shimmer!.]
[Gasp!.]
There's a Gem inside of Lion's mane! - A Gem? - Describe her.
Uh, hang on a sec.
[Shimmer!.]
Hey, wait! [Shimmer!.]
She's big.
[Shimmer!.]
Huh? Hey, don't go! With rainbow hair and tattoos.
Rainbow hair? What does her gem look like? - It's an innie? - It can't be.
Can't be what? - Steven, bring her out.
- Okay.
Hey! Little friend.
Ah! No, don't go! I believe I'm lost and there's no one here but us, so how
about a little help? [Shimmer!.]
Wow! A total stranger.
Pearl Garnet.
Bi-i-s mu-u-th! [Laughs.]
You're back! Whoa! Hey! [Laughs delightedly.]
The Pearl I know never jumps into my arms.
Hey, did somebody lose a pearl? - Who do you belong to? - Nobody.
Ha ha! All right, all right.
Settle down.
Oh, you're one to talk.
Oh, oh, excuse me.
You're two to talk.
Ah! [Laughs.]
Hey, cool it.
Your Ruby is showing.
Where have you been? We thought you'd been captured.
- Or, worse, shattered.
- Shatter me? Pssh! Homeworld couldn't lay a scratch on this Gem.
Ahem! Who is this? Guys, this is Bismuth.
She's one of the original Crystal Gems.
Oh, hey, new recruits! Welcome aboard.
We can always use more amethysts.
- And who's this meatball? - Hi.
I'm Steven.
You were in my lion and, now, you're in my house.
Well, thanks for having me.
I can't believe it! Rose said she lost track of you at the battle for the
Ziggaurat.
She was worried sick! Wait.
Where is Rose? Hi, um.
Actually, I'm Rose's son.
She kind of turned into me.
Well, I have her gem.
The rest is from my dad.
Oh.
There she is.
You do you know me? No.
I'm so sorry.
It's not always easy to understand Rose's choices, but we have to stand behind
them.
Rose really is somethin' else.
I mean, look at this! She really is somethin' else.
[Laughs.]
Wow! Everything's changing! And we're buildin' bases out of wood now?! Hmm.
Whose terrible idea was this? - And where is everybody else? - Everybody else?
Yeah, the rest of the Crystal Gems! Old Crazy Lace, Biggs, Snowflake.
[Resonating.]
[gasp.]
No.
No way! We were just here.
How long was I out? It's been about 5,300 years.
We, the Crystal Gems, were able to save the Earth.
But we're all that's left of the Rebellion, huh? Aw, come on, Pearl.
You know I can't take it when you cry like that.
[Sniffle.]
I'm sorry.
No.
No need to apologize.
Homeworld's final attack on Earth wiped out all of the Crystal Gems.
Rose was able to protect Garnet and myself and, by the looks of it, she was
able to protect you as well.
Ah! I knew those Homeworld elites were twisted.
How many of us did they shatter?! Crazy Lace? Biggs?! Snowflake?! If I was
there, I I could've stopped it! It's not like they've stopped trying.
What's that? Homeworld still has its eyes on this planet.
We continue to thwart their plans, over and over.
But they just keep coming back! - Yep, they want us, bad.
- Good.
I thought I wouldn't get another chance to show those upper crusts who's boss!
Let's show 'em what happens when you mess with the Crystal Gems.
Agggggh! Yeah.
Bismuth, the Gems on Homeworld outnumber us by a huge amount.
And their technology far surpasses anything we have available on Earth.
[Laughs.]
What else is new? Garnet, remember when you and I took on a battalion of Quartz
soldiers? We walked out with our stones shining brighter than when we walked
in.
[chuckle.]
As I recall, it was three battalions.
And, Pearl, remember when we stopped that drop ship? I'll never forget the look
on that Nephrite's face when you pulled her out of the cockpit! [laughs.]
I know.
How embarrassing for her.
Ha-ha! So let's pick up where we left off! - To the forge! - Yay! To the forge!
Yo, what's a forge? [Music.]
[Sparkle!.]
[Resonating.]
That brings back memories, huh? - Is this the forge? - [chuckling.]
Not yet.
Follow me.
Is this the forge? Ugh.
Don't ask me.
I've never been here before.
Pearl: Well, since Bismuth was gone, we've had no reason to come back here.
Let's just say this place ain't the same without me.
What does that mean? Amethyst! What do think you that means? I don't know,
dude.
I've never even seen this Gem before today.
We took a huge blow from Homeworld.
But, now, we're back in Bismuth.
[business.]
[Laughing.]
She's got jokes! Is this the forge? Pearl: Not quite.
[Resonating.]
- Wah.
- Wah.
[Slamming.]
Ta-da! - Wow.
- Now, that's an entrance.
Bravo, Bismuth! [Warbling.]
Aaaah! Bismuth.
Steven: Whoa! Pearl: It's just like I remember it.
It feels like an oven in here.
You think it's hot now? Yeah, like an oven.
[Laughs.]
Well, it's about to get way hotter! Ah, cool! Ooh.
Hah! Nothing like a hot lava bath to get into a working mood.
Uh, what, exactly, do you do here? Homeworld used us Bismuths to erect spires
and temples for the Gem elites to enjoy.
But Rose taught me that my life was my own, that I could choose to do whatever
I wanted.
So I chose this.
[Blows.]
Bismuth, you make weapons?! That's right! I outfitted the entire Rebellion.
Every material weapon used by the Crystal Gems was made right here in this
forge.
Wait.
Is it still here? Aha! Yes! Here.
Something to pack a little extra punch.
And why don't you try a trident.
- Oh, Bismuth, you shouldn't have.
- It's no big deal.
I was working on them since before Well, may as well give them to you now.
It was worth the wait.
Hey, it's a pleasure doing Bismuth with you.
[laughs.]
Bismuth is so funny.
I don't know.
Same joke twice? Well, it'll be really funny if she does it a third time.
Right.
Sorry, I I don't know.
I mean, she's one of the original Crystal Gems and no one ever mentioned her to
me, not even Rose? Don't you think that's a little bit, uh - suspicious? - I
guess that is a little strange.
Hey, deep cut, don't think I forgot about you.
What you packin'? Oh, this old thing? Oh, wow.
- What is it? - Well Not every Quartz can make a whip like this.
You mind if I take a look? Knock yourself out.
Hold on! I've got an idea.
[Clatter.]
Here.
With this, you can really do some damage.
[Clang!.]
[Gasping.]
Aw, yeah, baby.
[Clanging.]
Bismuth's the best! Homeworld treats us like dirt because we don't shine like
the elites.
But the Crystal Gems are back and we'll give those Diamonds another taste of
what's coming! [Clang.]
Now, show me what you got, soldiers.
Huh! Unh! I think the power couple's losin' their spark.
Hmm.
Who's next? Ha ha-a-a! Pearl, I don't recall asking you to bring me a spear.
Uhh! You won't like how I give it to you.
Ah! Lasers? When did that happen? Wha?! [cackle.]
I'm gonna wreck your Bismuth.
[Laughs.]
Very creative.
Yeah, I guess I am pretty great.
That's right! We are powerful.
We are important.
We! are! the Crystal Ge-e-e-e-e-ms! Steven, come down and show me what you're
made of! Uh, I would, but this is a little intense for me.
But it's a ritual for us Crystal Gems to spar before battle.
Well, actually, I have some rituals I like a little better.
Oh, yeah? Let me see 'em.
[Upbeat music plays.]
Huh! Ohh! [Warbling.]
Wha? [Laughs.]
[Resonating.]
[Warbling.]
The powerful, legendary demon blade, possessed by Muramasa.
With this demon blade, I will be the most powerful fighter in all the world!
No, Lonely Blade! Don't use it! What? If that thing's got infinite power, then,
of course Lonely Blade should use it.
It just makes sense.
It doesn't have to make sense.
It's entertainment.
Infinite powe-e-e-e-r! Bismuth, you can chill out here tonight and sleep, if
you want to.
You know what? I think I'll give it a try.
I like these new Crystal Gem rituals.
[Laughs.]
You know, usually, when I meet a new Gem, they try and kill me and it takes me
forever to become friends with them.
I guess I mean I'm really glad you're here.
Me, too.
Glad to have another chance.
So, tomorrow, you gonna show me what you got on the battlefield? Oh, I mean, I-
I would, but, most of my weapons are for defense.
Oh, except for one.
[Shimmer!.]
[Gasp.]
Rose's sword.
My finest piece of work.
You made this? You really don't remember, huh? Rose Quartz changed my life.
I came to Earth thinking this was just another colony.
Build another arena for important fighters to fight in, build another spire for
important thinkers to think in, and then, I met her.
Just another Quartz soldier, made right here in the dirt, but she was
different.
And she was different because she decided to be.
And she asked me what I wanted to build, and I'd never heard that before.
And Gems never hear they can be anything other than what they are, but Rose
opened our eyes.
Everybody always tells me how great Mom was.
I just don't feel like I can ever measure up to her.
[Laughs.]
I can't believe this, that I'm the one giving the pep talk to Rose's Rose's?
Son.
Right.
You are different.
That's what's so exciting.
You don't have to be like Rose Quartz.
You can be someone even better.
You can be you.
And you know what? You deserve an even better weapon.
I designed this sword for a fair fight.
It can cut through a Gem's physical form in an instant! Destroying the body,
but never the Gem.
Cool.
But Homeworld doesn't fight fair.
That's why we need a different strategy.
[Cluck-cluck.]
Ohh.
Whoa.
I was working on a weapon that would've been a gamechanger.
Homeworld knows how to hit us where it counts, but we can do everything they
can do, and better.
Here it is: the weapon that would've won the war.
[Resonating.]
Whoa! What is it? I call it a Breaking Point.
Cool! What does it do? Just watch.
Hah! Listen up, you Homeworld upper crusts! We are the Crystal Gems! Unh!
[Crackling.]
[Sizzling.]
[Blows.]
So, what do you think? Y-You shattered it.
That's right! One shot from this baby will shatter any Gem in the galaxy, in
the blink of an eye.
Shattering a Gem would destroy them forever.
Exactly! The Homeworld Gems won't be able to retake this planet when they're
reduced to shards.
There.
Now, you look like you real mean Bismuth.
[Music.]
[Sparkle!.]
Now, that's a real weapon.
Why don't you give it a test run? This one's got your name on it.
Wait, let me get out of your way.
Hooh! [Gasp.]
Ah.
Bismuth, I can't use this.
What? Why not? Shattering Gems, wouldn't that make us the same as Homeworld? Of
course not! We'd be shattering them for the sake of our cause, to protect our
allies, our friends, to free all Gems from Homeworld's tyranny! It's just, it
it's not what a Crystal Gem would do.
Don't tell me what a Crystal Gem would do.
Nobody's more Crystal Gem than I am.
If you won't take it, I'll just use it myself.
No! No one is using it! [Clanging.]
I'm sorry, Bismuth, but it's not right.
That's exactly what she said.
Huh? That's exactly what you said.
Uh, uh It is you, isn't it, Rose? Wha-What are you talking about? Don't lie to
me.
You can't expect me to believe you now, after you lied about everything? You're
lying about this new form, just like you lied to the others about me! But I
didn't just disappear, did I? You know what happened to me! [Resonating.]
- Mnh! - Unh! Uh! Wait! Bismuth! This is just a big misunderstanding! Liar!
Don't play games with me, Rose.
We were right here.
I offered you the secret to victory, and you refused.
The Breaking Point would've changed everything.
I didn't want to fight you, [Resonating.]
but you left me no choice! [Grunting.]
What type of leader doesn't give her army the best chance to win?! Ah! Ah!
[Gasp.]
How could you value the gems of our enemies more than our own? And look what
you've done without me, without the Breaking Point! Ah! Ah! Youlost! Ah!
Annnnh! Unh.
W-Wait.
I'm not my mom! I-I don't know what she did, but, I'm sure she didn't want to
hurt you.
It's too late.
I don't believe you anymore! [Grunts.]
Huh! Huh! All that talk about how Gems could take control of their own
identities, how we'd been convinced to ignore our own potential.
Ah! Hot! That's all it was, wasn't it? Just talk! Unh! Uh! [Suspenseful music
plays.]
[Sizzling.]
[Whimper.]
You should've listened to me, Rose.
I would've taken the war to Homeworld and shattered the Diamonds.
I would've liberated unh! everyone.
Ah! Unh! [Suspenseful music plays.]
[Groaning.]
[Grunting.]
Ah! Annh! Bismuth, watch out! Uh! Oh.
[Clanging.]
Aggh! Bismuth, this has to stop.
So, what are you gonna do, shatter me? Go ahead! Just do it! No! Even if we
don't agree, nobody deserves this.
Uhh.
[Sword slices.]
[Sizzling.]
Uh! You should've shattered me back then.
At least, if I were in pieces, I wouldn't have to know how little I mattered to
you.
[crying.]
You didn't even tell them.
You bubbled me away and didn't ever tell your friends - my friends.
- I'm going to tell them.
I'm gonna tell them everything.
[Laughs.]
Then you really are better than her.
[Warble.]
[Resonating.]
Steven! Oh, hey, dude.
[Panting.]
- Pearl: Oh! - Amethyst: What? There's something I need to tell you.
[Melancholy tune plays.]
[Bubbling.]
[Shimmer!.]
Sugar: # When I see the way you look # Shaken by how long it took I can do
about anything I could even learn How to love like you Love like you

**** Beta ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Insects buzz.]
Did you see that? Wapoosh! Just wapoosh! That's great, Amethyst.
- You're getting so fast.
- No! This is worse! This morning, it was like wsshh! Just wsshh! Superfast,
like wsshh, wsshh! Uh-huh.
I think this is why a day off would be good for you.
You should take a break from obsessing over Jasper.
Ugh, are you sure we have to do this now? Yes! Visiting Peridot and Lapis will
be so much fun! Yeah, 'cause when I think "fun," I think Lapis.
I wonder what they're up to.
Maybe they drove each other crazy and burnt the barn down.
Whoa.
They sure did something to the barn.
But, Paulette, I need you.
Oh, get over it, Percy.
Go make another friendship bracelet.
Seriously.
Lapis, Peridot, hi! Steven! It's so good to see you again! You, too, Lapis.
Amethyst! Something looks different about you.
Like what? Have you grown taller since the last time I saw you? Nope, still
short.
[Laughing.]
You're welcome.
For the joke.
Wow.
You guys are looking good.
And I love what you did to the barn.
Aw, I know.
But wait, wait! You guys have to see the inside! Lapis, fly us in! No.
Welcome to our home away from Homeworld.
Whoa! You made the wall an aquarium! Eww! You did all this stuff on purpose?
Like, you didn't just knock over a bunch of paint cans and go, "Enh, just leave
it"? Oh, no.
This was all very intentional.
You see, I had this idea: "What if we made music, but, instead of sounds, we
used things?" That's dumb.
Guys, that's art! Art? That sounds ridiculous! I've been calling it meep morp.
Let us show you our morps.
[Laughs.]
This piece is called Wow, Thanks.
It represents the struggles of intercommunication.
The tape is the ribbon that binds our experience on Earth together.
It has no functional purpose.
It just makes me feel bad.
Here's my meep morp.
This is a baseball bat.
It reminds me of when I played baseball.
This is the leaf Steven gave me.
It reminds me of the time Steven gave me a leaf.
Hey, yeah, it reminds me of that, too! [Static crackles.]
I just feel trapped.
[crackle.]
I just feel trapped.
Is this one about the thousands of years you spent trapped in a mirror?
[Crackling.]
No.
I just really like that show.
Oh, Amethyst, you'll love this one.
Check it out.
They're toilets? Right! [Laughs.]
What will I think of next?! This represents the time I spent imprisoned in your
bathroom, Steven.
I call it Occupied.
It's a collaborative piece.
[Resonating.]
- It's [gasp.]
amazing.
- I don't get it.
What's there to get? It's water! Shooting out of toilets! I can see that at
home.
All right.
I see you're not impressed.
But this hold on.
This this is what we've all been waiting for.
With the power of my metal abilities, I will impress the shirts right off of
you! Ta-da! It's a one-Gem metal band.
One, a-two, a-three, and [Inhales deeply.]
[Harmonica toots.]
Welp, that's as far as I've practiced that.
[Snort.]
[Laughter.]
Why don't you try one thing at a time? [stage whisper.]
Because we have guests, Lapis, guests who must be impressed! Hmm.
[Clang.]
[Clanging shimmering.]
We can try it together.
Yeah.
[Resonates.]
Isn't this great? [sigh.]
No.
Look at all this cool stuff they're doing.
This is all nothing! They've been out here playing with garbage.
But you love playing with garbage.
Not anymore.
Who has time for any that when Jasper is out there?! [Clatter.]
Ah, Amethyst, I, uh, try not to use the J-word [whispering.]
so loosely around here.
[sigh.]
I'm gonna go do something useful.
Wow, Amethyst doesn't seem to understand morps at all! No, [sigh.]
it's something else: Amethyst found out she's supposed to be just like Jasper.
Meh? Jasper took her down in a fight and, now, she's obsessed with getting a
rematch, to prove she's good enough.
Hmm.
[Clanging.]
Amethyst, Ams, Big A.
You are way better than Jasper.
What? Oh.
What did you tell her? I, uh What are you even doing, comparing yourself to
her? Oh, Amethyst, that's ridiculous.
I should call you Ridiculousthyst.
[Laughs.]
Hah! Yah! I mean, seriously, Amethyst and Jasper are two completely different
Quartzes.
Sure, you're both from Earth, but your Kindergartens are radically different.
What? Hold Hold on.
What?! We're both from Earth? Well, sure.
Amethyst, you're from the Prime Kindergarten, in Facet 5.
She's from the Beta Kindergarten, in Facet 9.
[Clang.]
Have you seen that place? No! Oh.
Well, maybe you should, so you could see how the other half was made.
Poorly! [laughs.]
No, seriously.
Let's go.
You'll get a kick out of this.
[Static crackles.]
[Poignant tune plays.]
That's your problem, Paulette.
You let yourself become the kayak race.
Cold.
Um, just one second.
I want to check and make sure Lapis is okay.
Hey, Lapis! Are you okay-y-y?! Yeah! - Are you sure? - Yeah! - I'm leavin', but
I'll be back! - Okay! - Do you need anything?! - No! - What season is that?! -
3! - Peridot, let's go.
- Okay, yeah.
Business time.
You know what to do with this! [Resonates.]
Here we are, Jasper's origin: the Beta Kindergarten.
[Sinister music plays.]
Am I underwhelmed? It's pretty bright out here.
It's red.
No kidding.
[scoff.]
Red sandstone! Ha! This is what I'm talking about.
We're lucky this place hasn't blown away.
Beta, am I right? [Laughs.]
That's a math joke, right? Come on.
It get's worse.
I mean, this place has got the right growing conditions, in a pinch, I guess,
but it's too small! It was obviously a total rush job.
A rush job? Halfway through the rebellion, Homeworld scrambled to generate
extra soldiers on the ground.
Look at this: the holes don't even line up! [scoff.]
It's like they just threw injectors down wherever.
Oh, and that one? This Carnelian came out sideways.
How could she not? The walls are curved! [laughs.]
What a joke.
Man, I-I had no idea.
I tell you, it really makes you appreciate the Prime Kindergarten, Amethyst.
Your Kindergarten was so thought-through.
Sure, you might've spent extra time in the ground, but everything else is
stacked in your favor: great location, great holes, even spacing, consistent
depth.
A real Kindergartener gets it right.
[Eerie music plays.]
What happened to this injector? What you want to see is a vertical alignment;
no angle in the exit; a clean, strong silhouette.
None of these holes come close! What about that one? [Sinister music climbs.]
[whispering.]
Jasper.
This is Jasper's hole? It's huge! Oh, come on.
We already know she's tall.
Let's take a closer look.
A Kindergartener can tell a lot Anh! about a Gem's makeup and Uh! flaws by
their exit marks.
Steven.
Oh.
Ah! Oof! Thanks.
Agh! You see, the problem here Wait.
Oh, wait.
Oh.
No, um Now this part Hmm.
There's this thing where, if you count the steps to the back, I can What is it?
She's even got frictional rock melt.
It's glass all the way to the back.
Actually, I, uh I've never seen an exit hole this perfect.
Ugh.
So it is true.
Amethyst, that doesn't matter.
Who you are isn't about where you came from; it's who you want to be! It's what
you've worked hard for.
It's what you care about.
That's what really matters.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right! Both: Yeah! It's about who I wanna be.
Both: Yeah! And I wanna be the Gem that beats Jasper into the dirt! - Yeah! -
Huh? Wait, no! Don't fight her! Are you not seeing this? She's the ultimate
Quartz! I'm doin' it, yeah, and not just for me, for all the weird holes out
here, like this guy, and skinny up there, - and and and this mess! - Amethyst,
that's Yeah, ha! I bet she was great.
No.
No, no, no, hold on.
Something's really wrong here.
These marks are new.
This hole's been dug out, recently.
Maybe it was a prairie dog? - A really big one? - Hmm.
- There's more! - Whoa.
These aren't exit holes anymore.
Then what are they? [growls.]
Aah! Both: Steven! [Cacophony of growling.]
Corrupted Gems, in cages? Why?! Who would do this?! [Gasp.]
That's who.
[Wind blows.]
Jasper.
[Resonates, cracks.]

Jasper! What is she doing? She's been collecting monsters.
[Growls.]
Pipe down! [Whimpers.]
[All gasp.]
You take orders from me now! You used to be a Quartz, too, didn't you? What
happened to you? [Snarls.]
Ugh! Disgraceful.
I can't believe I've resorted to recruiting you freaks! You're almost as bad as
that crystal runt.
[Growls.]
Just look at you.
This planet ruins everything.
Well [Laughs.]
except for me.
We should go back to the temple and grab reinforcements.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Amethyst? [Both gasp.]
Amethyst! I'll never let this planet twist me like it twisted you.
[Snarls.]
Your weakness embarrasses Homeworld.
You suffer because it's what you deserve.
We all only get what we deserve.
Right, Amethyst? Huh? [Screams.]
[Grunts.]
What do you want, runt? You here for a rematch? I'm here to win! You were fated
to lose the moment you came out wrong.
[Panting.]
That's not true! Rose.
Of course.
Your lackeys never stray far.
And why would they? They have no place in this or any world! What do you mean?
Every gem is made for a purpose to serve the order of the diamonds.
Those who cannot fit inside this order must be purged! To come out misshapen,
to reshape yourself outside your purpose, and to defend this ruined, worthless
planet is a disgrace! Peridot: This planet isn't all bad.
[Gasps.]
What are you doing here? I I'm a crystal gem now! [Dramatic music plays.]
I'm not afraid of you! I've got metal powers! I'll show you! [Grunting.]
Aw, geez.
In a moment.
Anyone else got something to say? No! It's just us.
Ugh! You guys! - Huh?! - Stay out of this! Amethyst! It's just you and me,
Jasper one on one! [Grunts.]
[Gasps.]
Go, Amethyst! Who's the runt now? You ready for more? [Growls.]
Th There's more where that came from.
[Grunting.]
[Gasps.]
Uh-oh.
[Grunts.]
[Coughing.]
Huh? [Gasps.]
Is it sinking in yet? Are you serious?! [Grunts.]
Amethyst! You never had a chance.
Heads up! - Huh? - Huh? Steven [Sighs.]
I can't win.
No matter what I do, no matter how hard I work, she came out right, and I came
out wrong.
That's just what Jasper thinks.
She's the only one who thinks you should be like her.
- But - Stop trying to be like Jasper.
You're nothing like Jasper! You're like me because we're both not like anybody!
And, yeah, it sucks.
But at least I've got you.
And you've got me.
So stop leaving me out of this.
Us worst Gems stick together [Sniffles.]
right? That's why we're the best.
[Chuckles.]
[Music.]
What a beautiful day! Huh?! Who are you supposed to be? Oh, yeah! Who am I now?
I feel like Amethyst knows this.
Forget your name you've got a fight to win! I think a Rose Quartz and an
Amethyst make a Smoky Quartz.
Is fusion the only trick you Crystal Gems know? I've got plenty of tricks.
Ever see sink the dink? [Grunting.]
[Laughing.]
[Growls.]
Whuh-oh.
[Rumbling.]
No! My army! [Laughing.]
Take that! Then take this! [Grunting.]
[Munching.]
Huh? Aw.
Leaving so soon? I will not be beaten by another fusion! [Grunts.]
What the [Shimmer!.]
[Laughs.]
[Growling.]
Hold on.
I've got a move that will really blow you away.
[Laughs.]

[Grunts.]
It's cool if you don't like it.
I've already got three huge fans.
[Screams.]
[Warble!.]
We could beat them if we stay together.
[Shimmer!.]
Breerrr.
[Loud crash.]
Great job, Smoky.
Oh, thank you, thank you, Smoky.
[Grunts.]
Nobody I fuse with ever wants to stay.
[Laughing.]
Ugh.
[Panting.]
- Ew! That's disgusting.
- It's corruption.
[Grunts.]
- Steven, be careful.
- But this just happened.
Maybe I can do something.
Jasper, it's okay.
I'm here.
[Panting.]
Rose.
I'm not Rose.
I'm Steven.
I just want to try and heal you.
[Shimmer!.]
[Growls.]
Steven! [Grunts.]
[Sighs.]
[Gasps.]
[Grunting.]
[Disgusted sigh.]
What? Stop.
[Laughs.]
I see how you do it now, Rose.
[Panting.]
You want Gems after they're worthless.
You wait until after they've lost.
Because when you're at the bottom, you'll follow anyone.
That makes you feel like less of a failure.
Ugh.
Just look at this one.
You've stripped her of everything her limb enhancers, her status, her dignity.
I still have one of those things.
How can you side with Rose Quartz? Why? Why protect this useless shell of a
planet? It's not a shell.
There's so much life.
Living here that's what I'm doing! I'm living here.
I've been learning new things about myself all the time, like how I can make
metal do my bidding.
[Clang!.]
The point being Earth can set you free.
Earth is a prison.
I got out because I'm better than this place.
It's getting worse.
I only came back to finish you off.
Try not to move.
You can't manipulate me, Rose Quartz.
I-I'm not manipulating.
I'm I'm trying to help.
Help? Help?! I've been fighting from the second I broke free of the Earth's
crust because of what you did to my colony, because of what you did to my
planet, because of what you did to my diamond! I Yellow Diamond? [Grunts.]
My diamond! Your diamond! Pink diamond! [Growling.]
[Snarling.]
[All gasp.]
[Grunts.]
[Explosion echoes.]
You're welcome.
[Sighs.]
Come here, sis.
When we get to the barn, I'm building a giant metal yo-yo.
Amethyst, Steven, you'll have to catch and throw it for me.
I don't want to do anything for, like, a month.
Uh Ugh.
I could even learn how to love like you Love like you

**** Back to the Moon ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in

chirping.]
Steven: The rubies are back? They showed up on their little ship acting very
angry, so I put them in time-out.
I thought we were done with these guys.
Why did you come back here? Let's release one and just ask what they're up to.
Ooh! Ooh! Can I pick?! Go for it.
Hmm.
Oh! Let's talk to Leggy! - Leggy? - I named them based on the placement of
their gems.
There's Leggy, Army, Navy, Eyeball, and, uh Doc.
Leggy seems like the easiest to talk to.
Leggy, come on down! [Grunts.]
Hey! Hi.
I'm Steven.
What brings you back to Earth? Uh I don't know? Oh, uh, I understand.
I used to forget why we'd go on missions all the time.
I'll just go stand over here then.
[Chuckles nervously.]
Let's take a chance on Army.
Good afternoon! [Growls.]
I'll tear you limb - Huh? - Hey.
Don't be like that.
Why, I ought to [Muttering.]
[Clicks tongue.]
Aw.
- Hey, what the - Next! UhNavy? If I remember correctly, we were on Earth Uh
[Chuckles nervously.]
This is so embarrassing.
Oh-ho.
Oh.
Aah! Aah! Okay.
Uh, eyeball? I'm not telling y'all nothing about nothing! [Growls.]
The only one left now is, uhDoc.
[Grunts.]
Where's Jasper?! Last time we came, you tricked us into playing that stupid
game! Then, you said, "She's on Neptune," so we looked, and she wasn't there!
She wasn't on Neptune or any other planet in this whole dang solar system! Tell
us where she is right now.
No games, no tricks, and no slick disguises.
Rubies: Yeah! Hey! [Puffs.]
I'm right here! Is she serious? There's no way this is gonna Eyeball: Look!
It's Jasper! [Cheering.]
Jasper! I'm Ruby 1F4-Cut-4ND.
I fought in the war for Earth.
[Imitating Jasper.]
Uh at ease.
I was on the ground in Facet 6 when I heard the tale of the Facet 9
Kindergarten Quartz That Could.
They said you popped out of the ground with your helmet on and took out 80
Crystal Gems before the sun went down.
When I found out this mission was to look for you, I nearly dissipated my form!
It is an honor to finally meet you.
[Normal voice.]
Yup.
That's me! Always huge, never small, all the all the time since I was made!
Wait a minute.
You look different than I thought you would.
Oh, here it is.
Oh, you must mean my tan you know, from the sun.
Stupid Earth sun! Ah! I hate this planet! Curse this planet! [All yelling.]
Well, it's a good thing we finally found you.
Yellow Diamond is awaiting your return.
We'll take you back to Homeworld right away.
No! I mean [Clears throat.]
[Imitating Jasper.]
I, Jasper, have decided to stay on Earth.
- What?! - Why?! Yeah, why, Jasper? Because I gotta stay here with these guys.
Yep, gotta keep 'em prisoner for the diamonds.
[Voice breaking.]
Jasper.
Such devotion.
Well, Yellow will definitely want to know about this.
You'll have to file a report at the nearest Diamond base.
Where's that? I think we passed it on the way here.
You dummies! It's, uh It's Hmm.
[Growls.]
It's there! [Normal voice.]
I gotta hold this all the way to the moon?! [As Jasper.]
Uh, hold this.
Hold theseprisoners.
Gotta bring the rebel prisoners if we're going to the moon.
Can't leave them here unsupervised.
Very well.
To the ship! What are you doing? This isn't going to work.
You can't hold that form forever.
[Normal voice.]
I can do this.
We'll go to the moon, come back, and they'll leave us alone.
Just play along.
Oh, hey! [Chuckles.]
You guys want to be prisoners, too? - Not really.
- All right.
Just checking.
Rubies: Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Whoa.
It's huge in here! [Door closes.]
I thought it'd be super-cramped.
Hey! This ain't no pleasure cruise! [As Jasper.]
Yeah! Show some respect, you Crystal Germs! Doc: Yeah, you tell 'em, Jasper!
Army: I bet they got those germs from Earth! [Snaps fingers.]
Aw, curses! I can't believe we've been caught! And by none other than Jasper!
I'm so cross over it.
Uh-huh.
That sure is Jasper the one that caught us.
Harumph.
Of all the indignities! Do what you want.
I'll never talk.
Huh, I wish.
Doc: Yeah.
[Laughs.]
She talks a lot! Go sit over there now! Wow! Jasper's so funny and strong! I
was just thinking that! [Normal voice.]
[Chuckles.]
This is fun! Jasper! Agh! I'm Jasper! Please feel free to take my seat right up
front the captain's seat.
It would be an honor.
Yeah.
[As Jasper.]
Yes.
Sure thing.
I hope it's to your liking.
It's all right.
You can go ahead and head towards the moon base whenever you're ready.
Buh Of course! Heh.
Hmm.
Uh [Whimpers.]
Uh, listen.
I'm Jasper, and I'm too worn out from catching rebels to fly, so I'll just sit
here, like this, and you work the thing to get us to the moon.
Got it? Yes, of course.
To the moon, then? To the moon, then! Rubies: To the moon, then! [Engine
warbling.]
[Music.]
We'll be arriving shortly.
Hey, keep my seat warm while I check on our, uh, prisoners.
Yes, Jasper.
Good idea.
No! Stay away from us, you brute! [Normal voice.]
Tone it down, Pearl.
That one ruby wants to throw you out into space.
Sorry.
Got a bit carried away.
Uh, you okay, Amethyst? You've been holding that form forever now.
I've got it under control.
[As Jasper.]
Hey, my seat better still be warm when I get over there! [Warbling stops.]
All clear! Right this way, Jasper.
Oh, Jasper, won't you ever let us go? Look at this place frozen in time.
An era-one base.
Her era-one base.
It was a tragedy, what happened to her.
Who is that anyway? Were you made yesterday?! That is Pink Diamond.
Jasper, maybe it's best if you explain.
[Normal voice.]
What, me? No.
[As Jasper.]
No, you do it.
I'm, like, too messed up about it.
I understand.
She was your original diamond.
Earth was Pink Diamond's colony.
Everything was going smoothly at first.
Kindergartens were incubating their first soldiers, big, warm pieces of quartz
like this mountain over here were being created from its rich minerals with
great success.
Then bam! One of Pink Diamond's very own quartz soldiers started a rebellion
and took it too far.
Where were you when it happened? Oh, you know, around.
I was there.
I saw it with my own eye.
I watched the leader of the Crystal Gems Rose Quartz shatter Pink Diamond! No.
Rose Quartz would never do that! A-And, sure, she had to fight but but she
would never shatter someone! Hey! We got a problem.
The panel is broken.
The communicator is gone! There's no way to contact Yellow Diamond from this
hub.
- Crystal Gems! - Unbelievable! - Rude! - No respect! [Sighs.]
See! They'll stoop to anything! We'll have to take you to Homeworld to file a
report in person.
I can't! I can't go! - Huh? - I don't understand.
- What do you mean? - What's going on? You know what? You know me.
Do me a favor and go back home and file the report for me.
I'm trusting you, soldier.
Wow.
Of course! That settles it.
All right, rubies, back to the ship! [Grunts.]
[Chuckling.]
All right, Amethyst! You really held it together.
You did it.
- I told you you could.
- [Chuckling.]
Aw.
[Music.]
[Door opens.]
Hey, you need a ride back to Earth? I could sit on your lap if you want, uh
What?! I'm still Jasper! We've been tricked again?! Rubies: No way! Rubies,
assemble! Rubies: Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.
Yeah! [Shimmer!.]
Yeah! We won't let you trick us again! Hey, rubies! If you're gonna fight, take
it outside! You can't get rid of us that easy! I bet she can.
Oof! [Screams.]
Steven! I could even learn how to love like you Love like you

way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #

[Ringing tone.]
[Groaning.]
The Rubies? Huh? Whoa! [Screaming.]
Oh, geez! Aah! - You! - Eyeball! [Gasps.]
There goes the Earth.
There goes my whole platoon! [Growls.]
This is a mess! What'll I say in my report? How will I even make my report?
This is a nightmare! And this is all your fault! Whoa! Hey, no, it's not! You
were trying to hurt my friends! But you opened the airlock in the moon base!
You sent us flying into space with no hope of ever returning! Okay, so maybe
that was my fault.
I'm sorry.
There, are you happy? No.
You're lucky you're in that bubble, or I'd pop you right in the face.
Well, if you're going to be a grump about it, then we can just float in silence
until we both die! - Sounds great.
- Fine! - I can't wait! - Me, neither! [Music.]
What? No signal? Come on, I'm right by a satellite.
If I don't die out here, first thing I do back on Earth is change my phone
plan.
[Growls.]
I shouldn't have ever come back to that dumb planet! When I heard rumors there
might still be Crystal Gems on Earth, I couldn't believe it.
A thousand years of fighting were all for nothing! And Rose Quartz might still
be alive? She must be! Why else would someone as important as Jasper be back on
Earth? For closure, that's why.
I wanted it, too.
I wanted to see Rose Quartz with my own eye.
At the very least, I thought Jasper might have some answers, but it wasn't even
her just another trick.
That's what you really wanted? To see Rose Quartz? More than anything.
Well, then today's your lucky day.
How's that? I know where Rose Quartz is.
What? Where is she?! She turned into me.
Right.
And I have two eyeballs which I don't! You expect me to believe anything, don't
you? Fool me once, shame on me.
Fool me four times, you already fooled me and you can't fool me again.
Look, I can prove it! I have her Rose Quartz gem! That's more of a pinkish-red
than a real Rose Quartz reddish pink.
That's because you're looking at it through my bubble! Hold on Here, check this
out! Look, I can summon her shield! It's got a rose on it and everything! Who
cares about her shield? Her huge sword is what I remember.
Uh, I left that in my lion [Grunting.]
Look.
Tell me you don't see the resemblance.
Are you kidding me? You're despicable.
We're gonna die out here, and you're just gonna make fun of me until we do.
[Sighs.]
You're even crueler than Rose Quartz.
[Clonk.]
Uh [Clonk.]
Uh, Eyeball? Eyeball?! That's not my [Gasps.]
Oh, great! Asteroids incoming! Find cover, soldier! I am in cover, you get
somewhere safe! [Grunting.]
Wow! I think I'm losing my luster.
[Grunting.]
[Screaming.]
Eyeball: We're heading right for that big one! No! Oh? Oh.
I'm alive.
[Sighs.]
We made it! [Laughing.]
I'm unstoppable! [Grunts.]
Eyeball! Oh, no! No! I've got you.
[Grunting.]
Oh, geez! You okay? [Gasps.]
Get off me! Whoa! What's wrong? [Warbling.]
Ay-yi-yi! Your gem is cracked! What?! This is just perfect! Don't worry I can
fix your gem! I'm not falling for any of your tricks! [Growls.]
[Groans.]
Bleh.
Hmm? I'm serious I can help.
Fine.
I guess I got nothing else to lose.
[Sighs.]
Thank you.
Blah Ah.
Eh?! What was that supposed to be?! What in the cosmos is wrong with you?
[Groans.]
See? It worked! I I can't believe it! There were rumors back during the war
that Rose Quartz could heal her Crystal Gem soldiers, keeping her small army in
contention with the superior forces of Homeworld.
Wow! It really is you! Rose Quartz! See?! That's what I was trying to tell ya!
[Laughs.]
Yup, it's me the mighty Rose Quartz! [Laughing.]
And now we're stuck out here, floating aimlessly through outer space! Pff!
[Laughs.]
How'd we get ourselves into this mess? [Laughing.]
[Laughs.]
The mighty Rose Quartz.
[Chuckles.]
Huh? I never thought I'd get a chance like this.
I can't believe you're all mine! Wah?! [Grunting.]
Why are you attacking me?! Don't act surprised, Rose Quartz! You shattered a
Diamond! Whoa! [Screams.]
[Laughing.]
[Screaming.]
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna take your gem and bring it back! What?! No!
Please don't take my gem! Wait, what would even happen to me? [Grunting.]
- Huh?! - Hmm? Ha! W-Wait! You don't have to do this! [Laughs.]
Oh, give it up already! You can't take this away from me! I'm gonna be a
legend! I'll go down in history! What will the Diamonds say when they hear that
a Ruby defeated Rose Quartz? They're gonna give me my own pearl! [Laughs.]
Wah?! Wait! Please listen! I'm really not my mom! I don't want to hurt you!
Just Just think for a second.
We're lost out in space.
How are you going to get back to Homeworld alone? I've already made up my mind.
[Gasps.]
Whoa! [Gasps.]
[Panting.]
[Sighs.]
[Warbling.]
[Music.]
If I could Begin to be Half of what you think of me I could do about anything I
could even learn how to love When I see The way you act Wondering when I'm
coming back I could do about anything I could even learn how to love Like you
How come nobody told me about Pink Diamond? We all did what we had to during
the war.
Everything's different now.
But did mom really do it? Did she really shatter her? She had to.
The Earth belonged to Pink Diamond.
Destroying her was the only way to save the planet.
For Amethyst to be herself, for Pearl to be free, for me to be together.
For you to exist.
But I thought a-at least she'd never She didn't always do what was best for
her.
But she always did what was best for Earth.
Even if it meant shattering someone? Yes.
[Sighs.]
Thanks for telling me.

**** Kindergarten Kid ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Creature snarling.]
Here's another one! Got it, Steven! Ready Go! - Grab its legs! - That's not a
leg! Ow! [Crash!.]
It's a little disturbing that Jasper was just keeping these corrupted Gems in
cages.
Isn't that what we're doing? That's different.
Garnet: They're cared for in the stasis of the bubble.
As long as they're bubbled, they can't hurt anyone and they won't suffer.
It's what Rose wanted.
Huh.
I guess this is the last of 'em.
[Snarls, roars.]
[Laughs.]
I can't believe these dumb things used to be Gems! Pearl, Amethyst, get ready.
This one is flighty.
Are corrupted Gems not like this on Homeworld? We don't have anything like this
on Homeworld.
Here we go.
Garnet! [Whip cracks.]
[Snarling.]
[Laughing.]
That was terrible! This is harder than it looks, you know! How could you all be
outsmarted by that thing? Well, first, it ran over Garnet, and then Amethyst
tried to use her Uh, we don't need the play by play.
Mistakes happen even when you can see the future.
Yeah, Peridot.
Let's see you do better.
Well, I saved all your butts from Jasper.
I suppose I could help you here, too.
Feel free.
This'll be a great chance to show off my metal powers! Then our work here is
done.
Uh, I-I'm Are you seriously going to help her? It's just she's all alone out
here, with no idea what she's doing.
Oh, Peridot will be fine.
I meant the monster! [Chuckles.]
Okay.
Take as long as you need.
Pearl: Uh, Garnet, are you sure? Wait! [Panting.]
Did the others ask you to bring me back? No, I came to help! It usually takes
all of us to capture a corrupted Gem.
That's because you try to out-brute it.
We're going to outsmart it! SoI can help? I could use your experience dealing
with these things.
- It just doesn't seem fair.
- Why's that? With you and me teaming up, that thing won't stand a chance.
[Both laughing.]
Yeah! After it! What's it doing? Maybe it likes shiny things? [Grunting.]
This is perfect! I've just concocted a flawless Peri-plan! - So what's the P.
P.
? - If I use my metal powers, the whole thing will fall onto the monster! Give
it a try! Carefully [Snarling.]
It'snot falling.
Maybe another leg needs to go.
[Gasps.]
[Growls.]
Fall! You stupid [Chatters.]
Oh, come on! [Grumbling.]
Fall already! Peridot, watch out! Oh, right.
Thank you.
[Grunts.]
Uh, Peridot! There it is! Get it! [Shrieking.]
Keep distracting it! I'll finish it off! [Thud!.]
You okay? I think we need to revise our strategy.
Peridot: Are you ready for the second Peri-plan? The first one wasn't so great.
Yes, noted, Steven.
But this plan is even more flawless! I cannibalized the injector to make a
rudimentary cannon! Observe.
Whoa! Impressive! You got that right.
This way, we can take it out from a distance! Oh, there it is! I got it!
[Shrieking.]
Heh, you clod.
[Click.]
Huh? [Sighs.]
Work, you stupid [Growling.]
Uhhey.
You win this round.
[Chuckles nervously.]
[Screams.]
Okay.
I've analyzed the problems with the previous two Peri-plans.
Relying on the injectors introduced too many complicating variables.
Now we only have to rely on simple physics! We'll wait until it gets right up
under us, not suspecting a thing because it's so dumb! And then we'll drop this
rock on its stupid head! It's even more flawless! And at this height, nothing
can fall on us! What if it doesn't stop where we want it to? I'm doing the best
I can, Steven! [Grunts, roars.]
[Screaming.]
I [Screaming.]
[Panting.]
[Screaming.]
I think You don't poof easily, huh? Us Peridots are tougher than we look!
[Insects chirping.]
Yes! This is going to work.
This is going to be perfect! This is going to be [Creaking.]
a waste of my time.
Why can't I master this? Aw, Peridot, it's okay.
Even if none of your Peri-plans worked, at least they were really funny.
The others will probably think so, too, when we go back and get 'em.
Go back? Let it be known that I, Peridot, refuse to move forward or back until
I am victorious.
Right.
I don't get it.
I'm smarted than your average Peridot.
How did I fail today against some barely functional, stupid, cloddy, dumb-
dumb?! Hey, hey, corruptions aren't dumb.
They just think a little different, that's all.
Okay, just to make sure my Earth vocabulary is correct on this let's say I'm a
monster.
I spend all my time slamming my face into hard objects and throwing my tongues
in the air for fun.
How am I not dumb? Well, she must be doing something right.
She hasn't fallen for any of your Peri-plans.
It's luck! Nothing that thing does makes any sense! Hey.
[Growls.]
[Yells.]
Why are you bombarding me with your confectionery puff rocks?! To show you what
it's like to be a monster! Pretend I'm a freaked-out human screaming at you in
fear! Pretend I'm an Earth animal chasing you away from your first safe hiding
spot! Pretend I'm an angry green Gem trying to poof you! This is life for you
now endless suffering! [Grunting.]
[Yells.]
[Panting.]
- There! You see? - Yeah.
What you're doing makes total sense.
You remember what it was like to have everything important taken away? Being
under attack? Feeling trapped? You were frustrated.
So is she! Why don't you try thinking about all of this - from her point of
view? - Hmm.
[Grunting.]
You can do it.
Ugh.
I can't take this dirty tongue-flapper seriously.
Thinklikea monster.
Blap! Blap! [Grunting happily.]
Blap! Aw.
[Chortles.]
Hey! [Gasps.]
It's okay! We don't want to fight! Just let Peridot bubble you! We can all get
along [Screaming.]
[Yelling.]
No, no, no, no, no! Give methatgem! [Screeches.]
Peridot! [Gasps.]
[Grunts.]
I did it.
[Sighs.]
Oh, hey, you're back! Eh, we never really left.
We knew it'd be funny.
Future vision.
Youyou were all watching this whole time? I told you I could do it.
But I have to admit, it was more difficult than expected.
This corrupted Gem was truly an adversary worthy of my skill.
Whoa! Peridot! Nice bubble, Peri! W-What do I do with it? Garnet: Send it off.
Just tap the top.
Happy trails! - So, where did it go? - Home.

Fusion
****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e02 Episode Script ******
**** Know Your Fusion ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - All: # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll
always save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always
find a way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe
in Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # - And then
we go into the tricks.
- All right.
But I really think we should save the dogwalker for next time.
This is our first impression.
We gotta go big.
And we should go soon, too, before they get suspicious.
Those two are acting very suspicious.
Should we ask them what's going on? - I can't.
- Right Steven, Amethyst! Is there something you'd like to tell us? So you guys
know how we recently had an epic showdown in the beta Kindergarten.
And you know that during it, we beat Jasper.
Both: But do you know who beat Jasper? You two? Peridot.
It didn't land.
Pick it back up.
Pick it back up! Ahem! We have someone we'd like you to meet! All right, let's
meet this mysterious stranger.
Heya.
I'm Smoky Quartz.
Nice to meet ya.
- [Gasps.]
What?! - Oh! Don't bother putting your socks back on, 'cause I'm about to knock
'em off again! [Gasping.]
[Babbling.]
Now, you guys can see exactly how I beat Jasper.
This is a little trick I like to call "Walk the Dog"! Wait! Explain everything!
[Screaming.]
This one's called "Jog the Dog"! Oh! No! [Continues screaming.]
Whoops! Ha! Uh, this one is called "Dog Walking's Just My Day Job Till I
Finally Get That Callback"! [Continues Screaming.]
Garnet, a little help.
Mnh-mnh-mnh! [Gasps.]
Sardonyx! You know the rules about weapons in the house.
Mostly allowed, really, but with some exceptions.
Oh, what a pleasure it is to meet you.
You've made quite the impression already.
In fact, there's one in the wall over there and there and Uh, sorry.
Looks like I got a bit carried away.
I can, uh reel it in.
Oh! [Laughs.]
Stop! But really, please stop.
Your act is tremendous.
But your stage is too small.
We need some space to get to know each other.
Somewhere a bit more infinite.
You have a room in the temple? It exists as long as I exist.
And here I am! Come now, don't be shy.
Bwooop! Smoky: I can't see nothing in here.
Sardonyc: You cannot see anything, my darling because the show hasn't started
yet! Show? [Footsteps.]
Live, from a metaphysical room deep in the temple, it's "Sardonyx Tonight"!
[Upbeat jazz playing.]
Good evening, everybody! [Cheers and applause.]
We have a brand-new fusion with us tonight.
I'm so excited, I could just shatter! [Cat screeches.]
Everyone welcome Smoky Quartz! [Cheers and applause.]
So tell me, literally, everything there is to know about yourself.
And do not skip out on any of the juicy details.
[Cheers and applause.]
[Chuckles.]
Well, I like, uh, long walks through the Kindergarten.
[Laughter.]
Actually, that's where I sort of pow became me.
And, uh, pow beat Jasper.
Oh, that Jasper, always running 'round Kindergartens and causing trouble.
Boy, that didn't quite work out for her.
Guess she should go back to preschool, am I right, folks? [Laughter.]
Yeah.
She lost her mind in a corrupted fusion.
I guess you could say she had a short fuse? [Chuckles.]
[Laughs.]
[Chuckles.]
Easy crowd, huh? Where'd you get 'em? I made them myself.
But, Smoky, I think what we really want to know is who are you? Who is Smoky
Quartz? Uh, well, between the fight and now, yeah, I've only really existed
for, like, 10 minutes, so, uh I-I don't know.
But I do know how to do this! Uh This one's called "Sad Baby in a Diaper"! Bow!
[Applause.]
Yes, the yo-yo.
Seen it, lived it, loved it! But what about the rest of your game? I ain't
exactly a deck of cards here.
[Laughter.]
Oh! I canlick my elbow.
I have three of them now.
[Makes buzzing sound.]
We'll be right back after a word from our sponsor! [Snaps fingers.]
Huh? Listen, Smoky, let's talk fusion to fusion.
That's a nice yo-yo, but I want to know the yo-you.
What? [Giggles.]
Smoky, there's bound to be way more to you than just a yo-yo.
[Glass shatters.]
You're a fusion.
You're full of surprises! You just don't know it yet.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess that is how surprises work.
I've got it! [Scream in distance.]
Every fusion gets something new a new power, a new weapon.
Like a yo-yo? Yes, but better.
Let's find out what's new about you.
[Snaps fingers.]
[Jazz theme plays.]
[Cheers and applause.]
And welcome back! Don't those cartoon characters make you want to buy those
products? I sure hope so, or else I'd be off air.
[Laughter and applause.]
[Laughs.]
We have a new segment for you all tonight.
That's right, everyone.
It's time to Hit That Bird! [Cheers and applause.]
During Opal's adventures at the sky spire, she took down a flock of bird
monsters with her bow.
Let's see if you've got her "opalescent" aim.
What do you say, Smoky? Are you ready to Hit That Bird? Oh! Ah, well, a bow is
kind of like a yo-yo, right? Except if the string went this a ways and Mm-hmm.
Let's start, shall we? Time is an impatient thing! [Squeak.]
[Grunts.]
[Groans, grunts.]
[Squeaks.]
Oh! [Bell rings.]
Uh-oh, time's up.
Let's see.
The score tallies to one, two, three zero.
[Audience groans.]
Guess I'm a real bow-zo, ha.
[Laughter.]
What do you say we move on to the next segment, everybody? Here we are! I call
this segment You Like That, Little Man? 'Cause everybody loves a callback.
[Laughter and applause.]
She's not actually in this episode.
Do we still have to pay her? Yes? Fair enough.
Now, it's no secret that us fine fusions pack an extra punch.
But Sugilite is a standout for being a heavy hitting powerhouse.
But maybe you've got something to top Sugilite's swing? Mmm, maybe? Just hit
the base with this mallet, and we'll see how you measure up.
Okay.
[Spits.]
[Grunts.]
That all you got? [Audience groans.]
Gosh.
Ooh! Very close.
An extra spin around always helps me! [Laughs.]
[Laughter.]
An extra spin, huh? Okay.
[Grunts.]
[Clink.]
Ha ha! Nice try! What?! One more time! [Grunts.]
You ain't nothing! [Growls.]
Hmm, yes.
Something just isn't hitting right here.
Maybe you're just strong In a different way We'll find out in just a moment.
[Applause.]
Play us over to stage right, Jorge! Uh Okay, don't worry about that crowd.
Don't worry about Jorge.
It's just you and me.
Yeah, no duh.
Actually who's Jorge? Smoky, you're holding out on me.
- I'm ready to see your main event.
- Ah, you and me both.
Now, Alexandrite has a throat full of flames.
Whether that's the cause of her raspy voice is up for debate, but there's no
room for questions when she attacks exhaling a burning blaze! So I call this
segment "Breath of Fire.
" Sardonyx, I don't know.
Come on, Smoky.
Step up and see if you can spit some elemental chaos at the target.
[Inhaling and exhaling deeply.]
[Burps.]
[Laughs.]
[Chuckles nervously.]
We seem to experiencing some magical difficulties.
But don't change the channel.
There must be some common thread between Steven and Amethyst that's heightened
by their fusion.
I don't know, Sards, I guess, uh, zero plus zero equals zero.
[Laughter.]
Something they both think.
Something they both do.
They say two wrongs don't make a right I guess I'm living proof that that's
true! [Laughter.]
[Chuckles.]
I'm just one big super wrong [Laughter grows louder.]
good-for-nothing dud with a yo-yo.
[Loud laughter.]
They want to impress us! They were planning this all morning.
We hijacked their show! I was excited! It's not about us! Huh? [Grunts.]
[Rumbling.]
[Screams.]
- What's happening?! - It's Sardonyx! If she's not here, the room can't exist!
Garnet! [Grunts.]
Pearl! [Grunts.]
[Rumbling continues.]
[Grunting.]
[Grunts.]
Huh? [Grunts.]
[Thud, all grunting.]
[All groaning.]
Sorry for the rough landing.
[Groans.]
What are you talking about?! That was amazing.
[Laughs.]
Oh, Amethyst! You've been such a good influence on him! It's kind of the other
way around.
You didn't tell us that yo-yo can grapple.
It can do so much stuff! Wait.
So do you use it like a lasso or a flail? It's better than a flail.
It's a toy! Pearl: It's so unexpected.
- Garnet: Give us the play-by-play.
- Amethyst: So, there we were [Wind howling.]
[Waves crashing.]

Book
****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e03 Episode Script ******
**** Buddy's Book ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in Garnet
# - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Cheering, laughing.]
Steven: Yeah! Great job parking, Lion! Eh.
It's a little crooked.
[Growls softly.]
Never mind.
It's perfect! [Chuckles.]
Is Lion gonna be okay parked out here? Oh, yeah.
Uh, I just gotta lock him up.
Boop, boop! Don't worry.
He's not going anywhere.
I still can't believe this'll be your first time inside of a library.
Why? Because libraries are full of your favorite thing.
[Music.]
[Gasps.]
Books! Shh! Books.
All right.
Time to beat these books.
Ah.
What'd they do to you? I'm mainly trying to get a head-start on seventh grade.
We'll be covering a lot of new stuff, so I just want to be prepared.
Can't you just use your phone to look stuff up? [Sighs.]
Last time I relied on the Internet for info, I ended up writing a very, uh
erroneous paper about raccoons having heat-vision.
Raccoons have heat vision?! Librarian: Shh! You should take a look around while
I get started.
There's tons of stuff here I'm sure you'll love.
Okay.
B-R-B.
Nonfiction? Wild.
[Grunts.]
Whee! [Laughs.]
Wow! There's even cool books on the bottom shelves! Huh? What are you doing
down here, little buddy? [Blows.]
It's blank! Whoa! [Gasps.]
Connie! - Look! - It's blank? It's the journal of first mate Buddy Buddwick! -
Like, the real thing? - Yeah! Jamie did a play about how Buddy helped the first
Mayor Dewey discover Beach City! There's even drawings of gem locations in
here! Oh, my gosh! Forget homework.
Let's take it from the top! Yeah! [Drum and fife music plays.]
Buddy: After narrowly escaping certain doom, Captain William Dewey and I, his
first mate Buddy, founded the land of Beach City.
With Captain Dewey's legacy cemented well, bronzed I wondered what my legacy
would be.
Would anyone remember my name? Or will it be washed away by the ocean of time?
I'm picturing buddy as Jamie being all sad.
Oh, yeah.
Drama zone.
No! I shall not disappear! I shan't die a lowly first mate! I schwill do
something great with my life! I'll comb the world in search of greatness! And
so began a new chapter of my life to explore the previously unexplored and to
make my mark on the world! I traveled for many days and nights until, finally,
I found myself in a field of sorts or, should I say, a field of swords,
intermingled with giant, sweet-smelling strawberries as big as one's head.
"Who could have wielded such a weapon?" I pondered.
"What sort of battle could this have been used for?" I contemplated.
I continued to sketch, sinking into deep concentration when I suddenly felt the
touch of a familiar hand.
Ahoy.
Salutations.
It was two of the Crystal Gems.
Hmm.
Would the Gems have looked different back then? Yes.
Definitely.
It was two of the Crystal Gems that had saved my captain from a sea beast.
And now we're here to save you.
But I'm not in peril.
I'm just a humble traveler who wants my name to be remembered by everyone for
all time.
Well, travel not here, traveler, as this place is very dangerous.
Very well.
I'll go elsewhere.
Wait! There are many places on this Earth that a human like you should avoid.
Here's a convenient marking of all the places where you should absolutely,
under no circumstances, visit if you'd like to keep your short life.
Only the bravest, most courageous, most memorable explorers would dare to visit
these fascinating places.
Yes, that's essentially what I just said.
Anyway, glad we cleared that up.
Fare thee well! [Bell dings.]
Surely, if I do explore these places, I'll be remembered as brave and
courageous! [Music.]
Steven: He drew the communication hub.
Connie: Sparkling slugs? Where'd he get these names from? Ooh! He got this one
right! I feel like I'm back there.
What's this place? I don't know this one.
Ooh! It looks like he went to the kindergarten! I found myself at the most
amazing locations.
Hmm.
Very pointy.
Though I could not shake the feeling that something about this journey felt a
bitoff.
Hmm.
I wonder why all these tiny caves are here.
Hey, Buddy! [Screams.]
Th-This is Buddy speaking.
Get out of my hole.
Lo, it was the third Crystal Gem.
Do you, uh, live here? Used to! Nowadays, I just come back every so often to
see how the fam's doing.
The fam? [Chuckles.]
Hey, how you been? Aw! You getting taller? Uh, give me a sec I have a visitor.
Why are you here?! Oh.
My apologies.
Here, I'll show you.
I've been traveling the globe as an adventurer and explorer.
Neat! I've been on a journey to discover places no one has ever been before.
But by the looks of this place, many people have been here before.
Hold on.
Did you make this map? It was drawn up for me by your compatriots.
So, pbht! What have you discovered on it? Well, I uh That is Oh.
Uh Oh, dear.
I haven't discovered a single thing on this map! Yeah, man.
You're just following someone else's footsteps.
And here I was, claiming to be a great explorer and adventurer, when all I
really am is a tourist! [Sobbing.]
Whoa.
Don't get all sad on me.
This is why my journey hasn't felt right! [Sobbing continues.]
Uh Uh, oh, yeah! Why don't you try and find the sand castle? [Sniffles.]
Uh, wha? Out of the way.
I'll show you.
It's right around here in this sandy area.
- Really? - Yeah! They say it's never in the same place twice.
It's always rebuilding itself all over the desert.
That sounds like the perfect adventure for me! And I'll be the first one to see
it! Heh.
Okay.
Thank you for your help.
Goodbye! Come back anytime! But not too much! [Birds squawking.]
I've been wandering this desert for 10 days now.
I suppose I could take off my explorer's coat for a bit of relief, but if I
wasn't wearing this, people would see me and think, "Oh, just some man
wandering around.
Not important at all.
Why, he can't even find the elusive sand castle!" "Ha, ha, ha" they'd say.
"What a fool," they'd continue.
Ugh.
This is it, then the end of my adventure.
I've just followed a map to my own end.
And this will be the last thing I ever see as I expire an angel and her one,
two, three several lions, here for my soul.
Is this the end? I guess so.
[Chuckling.]
Oh, wait.
There's a bunch more.
As I slowly regained consciousness, I became aware of a large figure in the
shape of a giant woman.
The ringlets of her hair spilled over her shoulders and back like a swath of
roses.
Mom! Hey.
Are you okay? I realized I was surrounded by her pack of Seven lions?! Please
don't eat me! Oh, don't worry.
We mean no harm.
That's good.
Ugh.
What brings a human out to a place like this? I was a first mate on a ship, but
we found land.
And then I realized I didn't want to stay in that land, so I went to find more
land.
But then I was told not to find that land because it was really dangerous.
But I wanted to prove myself and Look.
I wrote it all down here.
Why am I looking for the sand castle that probably doesn't even exist? A sand
castle? Yes.
I've combed these deserts for weeks, and there's been no sign of one.
Would that be a sign of one? That's it! I've gotta record this! I've got to
Wait.
You saw it first.
This doesn't count at all! I'm a terrible explorer.
Eat me.
It's all I'm good for.
Rose: Now, now, that's not true at all.
Sure, all these places have been explored before, but they haven't been
recorded so intimately as they have been in this journal.
It makes them new and special all over again for any reader to experience.
Have you ever considered becoming an author? And become an author I did.
I wrote up a storm, making book after book, so many until I realized I could
fill a library with them! [Gasps.]
I get it! Both: The Buddy Buddwick Library! Librarian: Shh! He really did leave
a mark on this town.
Whoa.
Hold the phone.
Is that what he looked like? Connie: [Chuckles.]
We imagined him way off.
- I kind of liked our version better.
- [Laughs.]
Me, too.
[Wind whistling.]
[Waves crashing.]

**** Mindful Education ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always

way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in

isn't it? - Yeah, I guess.
Ya know, uh, my dad told me I should probably expect this at some point, but I
didn't think it would happen overnight.
Right, yeah.
- Connie, I'm bald! - Oh.
What happened? Nothing.
It was just a joke.
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, are you okay? Steven, Connie! I hope you two are ready for today's
special lesson.
Oh, no, was I supposed to bring something? - Just yourselves.
- Garnet is going to sit in.
She's very excited to see you fight as Stevonnie.
Oh! Right! Fusion training.
I made a sign.
Woooop.
This side is for both of you.
And this side is for Stevonnie.
It's two signs in one.
A fusion sign.
[Laughs.]
Fusion joke! [Laughs weakly.]
- Ready, kids? - Yes, ma'am! - Connie! - Yes, ma'am! Ste-ven! Con-nie! Whoo!
Both: Initiating fusion dance.
[Music.]
Come at me, children.
[Both grunting.]
Let's dance.
Let us begin! [Grunting.]
Huh? [Chuckles.]
[Gasps.]
Oh! All right! Stevonnie's got floating powers! Time to finish the job! Huh?
I'm sorry! [Gasps.]
[Gasps.]
[Both grunting.]
Both: Steven! Connie! W-What happened? Mmmuh! [Groans.]
Connie, wait! Hey, what's wrong? I did something terrible at school, and I
don't know what to do.
Well, that doesn't sound like you.
What happened? I beat someone up.
What? A kid I didn't know.
He just bumped into me in the hallway.
I was so startled, my training instincts kicked in.
I just reacted.
I was so embarrassed, I just ran away.
But you didn't mean to hurt him! [Sighs.]
I know what it's like.
Sometimes, you hurt people by accident.
Y-you just have to try not to think about it.
Hold the phone.
Now give the phone to me.
For a fusion to work, there needs to be balance.
An imbalance can cause your fusion to lose touch with reality, see things that
aren't there, and eventually fall apart.
That is to say, if one of you is falling apart, your fusion will as well.
To find balance, you must understand your feelings.
To understand your feelings, you must see them clearly - without running from
them.
- See them clearly? I'll show you, but first, we'll need Stevonnie.
Mm.
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.
Garnet: Breathe.
[Inhales, exhales deeply.]
Here, in darkness, everything's okay.
Listen to the waves, and let them fade away.
Here comes a thought.
Huh? [Music.]
Garnet: # Take a moment to think of just # Flexibility, love, and trust Take a
moment to think of just Flexibility, love, and trust Here comes a thought That
might alarm you What someone said And how it harmed you Something you did That
failed to be charming Things that you said are suddenly swarming, and oh!
You're losing sight You're losing touch All these little things seem to matter
so much That they confuse you That I might lose you Take a moment, remind
yourself To take a moment and find yourself Take a moment to ask yourself If
this is how we fall apart But it's not, but it's not But it's not, but it's
not, but it's not It's okay, it's okay It's okay, it's okay, it's okay You've
got nothing, got nothing, Got nothing, got nothing to fear I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here Stevonnie: # Here comes a thought that might alarm me # What someone
said And how it harmed me Something I did That failed to be charming Things
that I said Are suddenly swarming And, oh, I'm losing sight I'm losing touch
All these little things seem to matter so much That they confuse me That I
might lose me Both: # Take a moment, remind yourself # To take a moment and
find yourself Take a moment and ask yourself If this is how we fall apart But
it's not, but it's not But it's not, but it's not, but it's not It's okay, it's
okay It's okay, it's okay, it's okay I've got nothing, got nothing Got nothing,
got nothing to fear I'm here, I'm here, I'm here And it was just a thought Just

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay We can watch, we can watch, we can watch, We
can watch them go by From here, from here, from here Stevonnie: # Take a moment
to think of just # Flexibility, love, and trust Take a moment to think of just
Flexibility, love, and trust [guitar plays.]
[Footsteps approaching quickly.]
Steven, I'm ready to train! I'm so glad we talked to Garnet.
I really figured out what I needed to do! I talked to Jeff! That's his name, by
the way.
Whoa, you did it.
I apologized and he understood! He actually wanted to know if I could show him
some moves.
[Laughs.]
That's great! It's funny.
I spent all that time feeling bad instead of doing something.
It's like I was trying not to think about it, and that just made it worse.
Now that I've got a clear head, we'll do so much better as Stevonnie.
Anyway, I'm gonna change! [Music.]
Great technique, Stevonnie.
- Whew! Keep it up! - Thanks, ma'am! Hyah! Uh, uh Oh, oh, uh Oh, no.
It's happening again! Who was that? Bismuth Steven oh, no.
It's coming from me now! - Stevonnie! - U-uh! - Breathe! - What's going on? -
What's happening to them? - They've got this! Y-Yeah, I'm I'm ugh.
Jasper I-I tried to help you.
You wouldn't listen.
I I told you to stop! I-I had no choice! I-I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be No! It's okay! It's okay to think about it! I thought I could,
but it's so much! I can't do it! Ahh! Ah! No.
No.
No.
Both: Stevonnie! [Gasps.]
We're falling! Steven, let's fuse! We can hover.
We'll be okay! Steven? I didn't want to hurt anyone! I'm sorry! None of them
would let me help them! - I had no choice! - It's okay! No, it's not! But it's
okay to think about it! - It feels so bad.
- That's okay, too! There was nothing else you could have done! - I don't want
to feel this way.
- You have to.
You have to be honest about how bad it feels so you can move on.
That's how it was for me.
[Sniffles.]
Okay.
Aaah-eeee! [Panting.]
Just breathe.
[Birds chirping.]
Mm-mm-mm.
[Sighs.]
[Laughs.]
[Sighs.]
I'm here.

Zoltron
****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e05 Episode Script ******
**** Future Boy Zoltron ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # And your dad won't even
let you alphabetize the condiments? That's rough.
[Mr.
Smiley whistling.]
Whoa, I want to see what that is.
Hi, Mr.
Smiley! Is that game new? [Laughs.]
Not even close.
I've had old Zoltron here in storage.
You got a quarter? We can see if he still works.
I am Zoltron, robot fortune teller from the future.
I know your future because I am from there.
Whoa! [Laughs.]
Go ahead, ask him anything.
I've just been dying to know.
Will I get that fancy kazoo I've always wanted? Your lucky numbers today are
16, 47, and "W.
" Can I have my quarter back? [Chuckles.]
If I had a quarter for every time somebody asked for their quarter back oh,
wait, I do! - Ba-da-bum-ching! - What? It was a joke.
Man, I must be rusty.
Been a while since my comedy days.
- You used to be a comedian? - Yeah.
But that was a long time ago.
What were some of your jokes? I'd rather not talk about it.
Did you have any knock-knock jokes? You want to ask questions, ask Zoltron.
Hey, Zoltron.
Why did Mr.
Smiley quit comedy? You can do it, buddy.
Aah! I just gave him a little tap! A little tap?! Do you know how expensive
this machine was?! I-It was an accident! I'll make it up to you! Please, I-
I just don't want to be banned from any more of your businesses! [Laughs.]
Hmm.
Hey, you do a pretty good robot voice, don't you? [Laughing.]
Lars: Sadie, come on.
It's like all you want to do is work.
Let's go watch a movie at your place or something.
Nobody will even notice we're gone.
[Chuckles.]
Somebody'll notice.
You know, when they need a doughnut or something.
Steven: Beep, bop, boop.
I am Zoltron, robot fortune teller from the future.
Fetch me a quarter and I'll find your fortune.
- What is that? - Don't change the subject.
I'm not.
This is just interesting.
Ask me anything.
Ugh.
Look at its face.
All right, Zoltron.
Since you know everything, should we skip work? Oh, great.
Sick the robot on me.
You should go to work because because even though Lars won't admit it, he
really likes to do a good job.
Letting people depend on him fills his heart with warm feelings like love and
trust.
No, it doesn't.
And even though Sadie loves to take charge No, I don't.
she'll still be really impressed with all of your effort.
Is it weird that it knows our names? Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.
- You want to go to work? - Yeah, let's.
Halt! If you're not careful, Zoltron sees prison bars in your future.
[Sighs.]
[Music.]
Zoltron sees that both of you are right.
You do deserve your own rooms.
Zoltron predicts you won't need to worry about that stain.
You can make anything look cool.
Zoltron knows that even if he seems stuck in his ways, deep down, your father
really loves you.
- How's it going out here? - Great! I really feel like I'm making a positive
change in people's lives.
- Are they paying you for it? - Yes, sir! Then keep it up, Zoltron! Sure! [Wind
whistling.]
[British accent.]
Hmm, a fortune-telling machine.
This should be good for a laugh.
That's right.
I am Zoltron! Beep, boop! Give me your questions and your money.
Was it a mistake to come here? Zoltron says, uh of course not? Um Funland is
fun for all ages.
Will talking to him make any difference? - Any difference at all? - Zoltron
isn't sure.
Human emotions are really complicated for Zoltron.
Tell me the truth.
Do I really just drive everyone around me away? Z-Zoltron says your lucky
numbers for today are 16, 47, and "W.
" Come back later? [Gasps.]
My final quarter.
[Sighs.]
Even coins don't want to be around me.
[Sighs.]
Poor guy.
I wish I knew what to tell him.
If only I could see into the future like Garnet can.
I knew you'd say that.
Garnet! I-I need your help with The future.
Oh, yeah! I need some of that.
Can I borrow your future vision? I want to help some random stranger I just
met.
That seems like an appropriate use of my powers.
[Smooches.]
There you go.
That should last a little while.
Try to be home in time for dinner! Thanks, Garnet! He's ready to answer your
question.
Use this.
What would he say if he saw me now? He'll say, "I'm happy to see you.
" You're lying.
Nobody's happy to see me.
He'll say, "It's been too long.
" I'm too late? I should've come sooner! I don't know, I'm just a boy in a
costume! [Sighs.]
Of course.
Everything in my life's a disappointment.
[Buzzer.]
Zoltron sees sadness in your future no matter what you do.
That sounds about right.
I guess the curtain really did close on Mr.
Smiley and Mr.
Frowney.
You're here to see Mr.
Smiley?! [Gasps.]
Nobody misses our act, not even him.
[Sighs.]
I don't know why I'm talking to a machine.
I'll just get on the bus and leave.
Zoltron says that's a question for your doctor.
Uh, Mr.
Smiley! Mr.
Smiley! Hey, don't break character.
You broke enough things today.
- I met Mr.
Frowney.
- What?! He's in town.
Uh, how did you know him? We used to have a routine.
Oh! Comedy.
But he didn't seem very funny.
Actually, he was really depressing.
Yeah, that was the bit.
At least, I thought it was, but even offstage, he was always sad.
Nothing would cheer him up, not even a packed house, not a standing ovation,
not even me.
- And, boy, did I try.
- Well, he's about to leave town on a bus.
You should go talk to him before it's too late! I don't know what'd happen if I
did.
Wow! Funny running into you.
Of course.
I'm still a punchline, aren't I? Hey! Wow! You look great! That's your best
joke yet.
Hi, buddy! Is that all you have to say? [Buzzer.]
Zoltron sees sadness in your future, no matter what you do.
Ugh.
Come on, Steven.
Drop the act.
Wait a second.
You said you were always trying to make him happy.
Did he even know that he was making you sad? - You said he was getting on a
bus? - Yeah.
[Music.]
- Harold? - Quentin.
How'd you know I was here? Little robot boy from the future told me.
- Uh, hi, again.
- He came to life! [Chuckles.]
No, fool.
Did you just come here to laugh at me? No! I'm here to tell you that I wanted
it to work our act.
But it wasn't making you happy.
I just wanted you to take it seriously.
And I just wanted you to have fun.
Oh.
I guess it was never going to work.
But I really thought we had something.
- You having a bad day, Frowney? - Horrible.
Well, why don't you go outside?! - The sun always cheers me up! - I did, but it
rained.
- Why don't you use an umbrella? - I did, but it blew away.
Ooh! You must have been shocked! Yeah, that's when the lightning hit me.
Oh! Smiley, what do you do you do when you're feeling down? I just take my
frown and turn it around! [Chuckles.]
Hey, you're ruining the bit! I thought you were a professional.
[Chuckles.]
[Sighs.]
I think I finally got the joke.
Well, I guess my debt is repaid.
[Laughter.]
Steven, that machine cost thousands of dollars.
Zoltron sees cramped legs in his future.

Out of Beach City
****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e06 Episode Script ******
**** Last One Out of Beach City ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Ball bouncing
loudly.]
Amethyst.
Do you mind not bouncing so much? Ooh.
[Laughs.]
Sorry.
I'm just super excited.
- Greg is taking me to a show! - A show? You mean like, at the thee-ay-terr?
No.
Like at a rrrra-ha-hock show! Heh.
Like a band! At a house! With a whole bunch of people hanging out and doing
stuff! Ooh! Man, that sounds cool.
We have an awesome night planned, too.
- We're doing a puzzle.
- Wow-wee.
I know it sounds tame, but it has 612 pieces.
And no corners! - I found a corner.
- Oh! Oh.
[Door opens.]
Greg: Hey, y'all.
Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg! So, you ready to throw down in the pit? No pits for me
tonight.
I'm sorry, Amethyst.
It totally slipped my mind that Barb invited me and - Vidalia over for cards.
- Cards? [Groans.]
Who broke you guys out of the retirement home? Trust me, I'd love to go to the
show! But Barb threatened to hold my mail if I didn't.
And she's not a woman of empty threats.
[creepy music.]
[Groans.]
Man, forget it.
I can't go "show-lo.
" That'll be boring.
You could hang out with us tonight.
And do a puzzle? Ha! Maybe we can fit in some knitting, too.
That's not what I meant.
We could go to the show with you.
- Really? - Whaaaa? You want to go to a show? With loud music, and people
pushing each other?! I've done my fair share of pushing.
Ohh, I think it's broken.
You two just never saw me in action! Breaking every rule, taking on the
authorities, so I could indulge in the joys of life on Earth! - Oh! A sky
piece.
- Nice.
Well, if you'd like to go, you guys can take the Dondai.
Thank you, Greg.
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Rock show! Hold on, Pearl.
This is a human thing, not a Gem war.
Before you rock out, you're gonna want to blend in.
Now you're looking good.
Oh, yes.
But I can make it look even gooder.
It's cool, because the collar isn't supposed to go that way.
You're a natural.
We're almost set on snacks for the road.
We just need some beverages.
Strawberry sugar shock shut down or good old fashioned apple juice? Definitely
sugar shock shut down.
It turns everything red.
[Crunch.]
I'll have one too, Steven.
I think I'll try drinking tonight.
Wow, really? I didn't know you liked apple juice? There's a lot you don't know
about me, Steven.
Whoa.
So, Amethyst, tell me more about this band we're seeing.
We're going to see Mike Krol.
He's got that real garage vibe.
Songs about being nostalgic for the suburbs.
Nostalgic for the suburbs? Pssh.
They've only existed for what? 70 years.
[Laughs.]
Okay, so, when we get to the show, you got to walk in like you own the place.
[Store bell dings.]
[Music.]
Oh! Hey, right there.
Perfect example.
- Pearl, you okay? - Uh I just didn't realize Humans could come with pink hair.
Steven: [Laughs.]
They don't.
You got to go to the store and get this goo.
It smells really bad, and it turns your hair whatever color you want.
Why would she do that? - Why don't you go and ask her.
- Hey, yeah! We're about to go hang out with a bunch of cool Humans.
Go do a practice round! Do it! Do it! Do it! [Whistling.]
[Crash.]
I uh [Store bell dings.]
Wow-w-w-w-w! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wow.
[Seat belt clicks.]
Welp, you sure showed those cups who's boss.
Amethyst, seatbelt.
[Click.]
Now let's go have the night of our lives.
I'll burn like for you [Rock music plays.]
You can follow me home Okay, nobody's gonna say it? She kind of looked like
mom.
You noticed.
I noticed.
We all noticed.
Oh.
Ohhh! That's why you were acting like such a goon! [Laughs.]
No, no.
That's not it.
I'm done thinking about the past.
Tonight, I'm all about the future.
I'm going to a show.
I'm a new Gem who loves socializing with Humans.
That's what that was? Look, you weren't there by the cups.
I could've talked to her.
The timing was just wrong.
[Motorcycle engine roaring.]
[Gulps.]
It's the girl! She's driving right next to us! - No way! - You've got another
chance! - Yeah! Do something! - Like what? Flash my lights? Honk at her? - Just
shoot her a look.
- Wait not yet.
Okay, okay.
You can look now! [Music continues.]
With all my friends I'm going to good show Ooh, and there she goes.
Hey, maybe she's going to the same show as us.
I don't know, a girl that cool probably knows about a billion shows going on
tonight.
[Beat thumping loudly.]
[Gear shifts, tires squeal.]
Pearl! Aaaah! [Laughing.]
Yeah, P! What are you doing? The light was red! I know.
- There she is! - What's your plan? - New Pearl.
No plan.
- Ah, no kidding.
[Police siren wailing.]
[Gasps.]
Ooh.
- The police want us! - Oh, snap! [Gasps.]
What do I do?! You have to pull over to the side and show them your license.
- I don't have a license.
- [Laughs.]
Oh, right.
- But But, you're old! - What was I supposed to tell the DMV? That I'm from
another planet? - I'm not exactly a citizen, Steven! - Then what do we do?
Would you believe me [Engine revving.]
[Both scream.]
[Police siren wailing.]
[Turns up volume.]
Aaaah! Pearl, you can't just drive away! This is serious! Pearl, you're a total
bad [Tires squealing.]
This is why we buckle up.
Hold on! - Whoo-hoo! [Laughs.]
- Oh, boy.
[Tired screech.]
Shh.
[Police siren wailing.]
- Are they gone? - I think so.
[All sigh.]
[Engine sputtering.]
- Guh! - What is it? - [Sighs.]
We're out of gas.
- Aw, what? Wait! I'll find a gas station.
Looks like the closest one is 20 miles away.
[Groans.]
[Crickets chirping.]
- I can't believe this.
- Huh? I was so ready! I really wanted to see your Krol.
What are you talking about? I was going to drink a juice and wear these
[grunting.]
pants! Ugh! And [grunts.]
hit people gently enough as to not actually hurt them, and you'd say, "Wow!
Pearl is really cool!" But no, instead, we drove to loud music, chased a
mysterious woman into the night, and broke the law.
[Sighs.]
I've lost my edge.
I should have stayed home with the puzzle.
Listen to yourself.
You're so hard core! Who cares about pants? You gunned it from the cops! That's
the most scared I've been since you almost let me die! - You're a criminal now!
- "Now?" [Grunts.]
I've been a criminal for 6,000 years.
[Laughs.]
[Music plays in distance.]
Wait.
Do you hear that? - Oh.
- We made it! I'm like a star I'm burning out fast I try to shine But it's
never gonna last [Gasps.]
And there's the girl.
She's actually here.
- No way.
- I'm going to talk to her.
Look, Pearl.
I already think you're cool.
You can ease into "the socializing with Humans" thing.
Watch Steven for me.
Wait, no! You can start smaller! - Talk to a nerd! - Amethyst.
Aw, no! Ooh.
She's starting with a handshake? Oh, she went for it.
They're both smiling.
Amethyst: [Sighs.]
I can't believe this.
What is Pearl saying? I don't know, but the girl's laughing.
You think she's laughing at her or with her? Hard to tell.
Shh-shh! She's coming back! - How'd it go? - I asked her about her hair, and
then she asked how I colored mine.
I told her "My appearance is just a conscious manifestation of light.
" And she said, "I know how that is.
" Although, [laughs.]
I highly doubt it.
Oh, and then I added, "By the way, I saved your planet and your species and
you're welcome.
" - And how'd that go over? - Not very well.
She walked off after giving me some sort of code.
[Laughing.]
- No way! - Pearl, that's a phone number! She wants you to call her and talk to
her on the phone! - Oh, well, I don't have a phone.
- Pearl! You just like gave her some Shakespearean spiel about light then got
her number like it was nothing! [Laughs.]
Pearl, you're a total rock star! What if I told you that the world was gonna
end? And you had 15 minutes to spend with me or your friends Would you take The
first bus over to my house Or would you take the last plane over the West
Coast? See, it's times like these with the change of heart It was over and done

****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e07 Episode Script ******
**** Onion Gang ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Panting.]
Onion sure was having a phenomenal time jumping with Steven on his couch.
But after two hours of jumping, he decided that it was time to perhaps stop and
do something else? Ah, so Onion decided he wanted a snack.
And he knew he could help himself to anything in Steven's kitchen.
[Sighs.]
Including Steven's favorite limited edition chips.
Onion smelled the chip, savoring its delicious aroma.
But no snack could satisfy his hunger for power.
[Horn blowing in distance.]
Oh, looks like you're dad's home, huh? I guess this round of "Onion Tales" has
come to an end.
See ya! Epilogue things get a little lonely for Onion, not knowing any other
kids his age.
But luckily he had his friend Steven who would kindly donate some time to a
youth in need.
[Knocking.]
Coming! Oh, Onion.
Need someone to hang out with again? Come on in.
Oh, I see.
Onion wanted to come in, but he paused in the doorway.
He needed to take his shoes off, but he didn't know how.
You want to go somewhere else? Yeh! Whoa! [Music.]
Hi, Vidalia! Hi, Yellowta-a-a-ail.
W-We just ran past your house, Onion! Where are you taking me? [Panting.]
Whoa, ugh! [Groans.]
Where are we? [Whistles.]
Whoa.
I didn't know you could whistle like that! [Branches rustle.]
Huh? [Footsteps approach.]
Is someone there? Garbanzo! Aah! Who are you? Your slow and eerie approach is
making me uncomfortable! Huh? Aah! [Panting.]
Onion, run! [Thud.]
Yipe! [Grunts.]
Looks like it's curtains for Steven Universe.
Onion, huh? Uh, do you know these guys, Onion? Oh, they're your friends! - Uh,
my name's Steven.
- Garbanzo.
I guess, you're Garbanzo? Since you're named after a bean then the baby on your
back must be Pinto? [Pinto coos.]
And your name is Oh, Squash! And to my left, we have [Pot clanks.]
Slingshot? [Pot clanks.]
Uh, pot hat? [Pot clanks.]
Uh, I don't know.
S S-S-Soup? [Mwah!.]
Whew! [Laughs.]
It's nice to meet all of you.
Huh? What a warm welcome.
[Chuckles nervously.]
H-Hey, that's my wallet! [Clank.]
[Clank.]
Onion, this whole time I thought you were just a lonely boy.
But you have a whole pantry of friends! Thanks for bringing me here.
[Squeaking.]
[Chuckling.]
Garbanzo.
Cool! A soap-box derby car thing! Can I lend you all a hand? [Chuckles.]
Garbanzo.
[Hammer thuds, torch sizzles.]
Is that safe? Garbanzo! This looks amazing! Is there enough room for me?
[Grunts.]
All right, let's roll! Whoa! It even goes up steep hills! Yay! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Swerve-y! [Laughs.]
[Thud.]
Garbanzo! Uh What's going on? Gar Gar Garbanzo.
Wait! He's gonna be okay, right? It was just a little spill! Gar banzo-o-o-o G-
G-Garbanzo? Is this really happening? Oh, Pinto I don't know what to say.
This is all happened so suddenly.
I-I'll call a medical professional! Ga Garbanzo! It's a miracle! Pinto has
healing pow ers? W-Why'd you nudge me and wink like this was all a big joke?
[Chuckles dryly.]
I I get it.
Heh.
G-Good joke.
Hmm.
Y'all Y'all really got me with that.
Whoa! That is a huge trench coat! What're you gonna do with that? You're gonna
pretend to be grown? Can I pretend with you? Yippee! [Grunts.]
Man, we look so grown up! What should we do first? Buy a car? Stay in a fancy
hotel? Vote? Hey, is that Suitcase Sam? You think if we bump into him, he'll
call us "sir?" That would be funny! Oh, are we doing it? [Imitating deep
voice.]
Hello, Suitcase Sam, sir! It is I, your faithful customer, Mister Mature Man.
[Camera clicks.]
Aah! [Normally.]
W-Why'd you do that? [Camera whirs.]
[Laughing.]
Garbanzo! [Laughs.]
Huh? Man I always thought when we weren't hanging out, you were just sitting
alone on the boardwalk, Onion.
How long has this been going on? What's going on over here? Just drawing in the
dirt, Eh? That's cool, that's not creepy.
Right, Soup? [Bugs skitter.]
[Gasps.]
Ehhhh.
Uh okay.
Ugh.
What should I Oh, okay.
Is this a race? Y-You're racing bugs? [Chuckles.]
That's fun! Onion: Mama-ma, mama, ma! Come on! You can do it! Garbanzo!
Garbanzo! Come on Mr.
Buggy! Mama-mama! Come on! You can do it! Keep going! Whoo-hoo! I won!
Garbanzo! Maa! Mama-mama-mama-maa! Maa! [Laughs.]
Garbanzo.
For me? Thank you! Huh? [Beetle skitters.]
What? You want me to But But he won! [Dramatic music plays.]
I I I can't do it! Bugs may be weird, but I don't want to kill one! [Sigh.]
I'm sorry.
I'm going home! Ma! [Cellphone clacking.]
All right.
Whew! No more weirdo friends.
Let's see I bet my best friend Connie is free.
[Cellphone autodials.]
Hey, Connie! It's me, Steven! I I was wondering if you Um, no, th-there's no
mission, I wanted to hang out! You gotta do back to school shopping? Oh, okay.
Say hi to the pencils for me.
Well, I bet Peedee wants to hang.
[Cellphone chimes, vibrates.]
No big deal.
I-I'm sure someone else is free.
Um oh.
Looks like the lonely boy with no friends his age was actually Steven.
[Knocking.]
No, Onion! Just leave me alone! You don't have to play with me anymore.
[Rapid footfalls.]
What are you doing?! [Thud.]
No, Onion! [Scoffs.]
Onion, listen! I figured it out! The only reason you hang out with me is 'cause
you feel bad for me, isn't it? You don't have to lie to me to protect my
feelings! Those kids out there in the woods? You understand each other and you
don't even talk! They're your real friends.
So just go! I don't need you to pity me.
That's the one thing I can do by myself.
Hmm? Hey, you're you're the winner of the bug race.
Wait! Onion! I'm sorry! Onion, wa-a-ait! [Panting.]
Guys, I'm sorry! It was me! I was the lonely boy! I Hey, what's going on? Wait
are you guys leaving? I'm sorry about being weirded out before! You don't have
to leave! Oh.
I-I get it now.
You guys only come to Beach City during the summer months.
And since the fall is starting, it must be time for you to go home.
[Crying.]
Garbanzo! I don't know what to say.
I Aww! Thanks for letting me hangout with you guys You're all swell! Goodbye!
I'll never forget you all! So, that's why you wanted me to come back here so
much.
This was your last chance to have all your friends in the same place.
Uh Onion felt really sad about his summer friends leaving.
But then, he started to feel a little better.
He remembered all the great times he had with his friends and all the cool
stuff they did together! And until next summer, he had his pal Steven to
hangout with i-if he wants to.
[Chuckling.]
Aww, buddy

**** Gem Harvest ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Wind blows,
leaves rustle.]
Peridot! Lapis! I'm here! Did you forget your favorite Steven was coming over
to spend the night? Aha! A door-knocky thing! Unh! [Clatter.]
Hey, that looks new.
Peridot! Lapis! I'm sorry I broke your door thingy! I wanted to fix it, but I
don't know how it goes together.
Makes a pretty neat mask, though.
Wow! Did I just die and go to the back of a cereal box? Ah! Aaaah! Hi, Steven.
Steven! I'm on a tractor! Did I spray you by accident? [chuckle.]
Just a little.
[Blubbering.]
[chuckle.]
So glad you could make it.
Steven! How do you like our little Uhh! Experiment?! It's amazing.
What made you wanna start farming stuff, all of a sudden? I have all the skills
required for growing Gems.
I figured, why not try growing something else? Who knows? Maybe they're ready
right now.
Mnh! Yah! Hello, corn.
Maybe she can't hear me in there.
I made you in my image! You will do as I say! [laughs.]
Wait.
You didn't think the corn was gonna walk right out of the ground when you told
it to, did you? That's not how vegetables work.
It's not? Well, then, what's the point of corn?! I have to admit, I've really
been starting to miss the pitter-patter of full-sized Gem soldiers.
It does get pretty quiet around here.
Come on, Lapis.
Let's go disassemble the tractor.
All they wanted to do is make a living vegetable.
Wait! I know how to do that.
Garnet says not to lick stuff I find on the ground, but, this is for a good
cause.
[Insects buzz.]
[Leaves rustle.]
Hurry, Steven! Peridot, slow down.
But you need to see.
We did it! [Barking.]
Guess you don't know how vegetables work, after all.
[Laughs.]
Yeah.
You guys sure showed me.
[Continues barking.]
Come, now, my little creation.
You can assist in harvesting the rest of your kind.
[Whines.]
[Barking.]
[Whines.]
Uh, must be the pumpkin treats in my back pocket.
[chuckle.]
That doesn't make sense.
We made it! It should listen to us! It's only just come into existence and it
already doesn't like us.
Oh, come on.
[chuckle.]
Go to Peridot and Lapis.
Oop.
[purring.]
Ahhhh.
I'm sorry.
I think he's coming to me because I'm the one who made him.
Oh.
That explains it.
Well, we made this one.
It'sokay.
But look at Steven's.
[crying.]
It has a face, and everything.
It's true.
Ours doesn't have a face.
Oh, no! Don't be sad.
Wait right here.
I have an idea! [Barking.]
My dad showed me how to do this, once.
[Panting.]
First, we make a mouth.
Nyah! Huh? Then we make two eyes.
[Whimpering.]
Hmm, lookin' pretty good.
Oh, you know what? I almost forgot a really important step.
Nyah! [Innards squelch.]
You have to hollow it out.
[Splat!.]
Aah! Aah-aah! Aah-aah-aah! [Panting.]
[Growl.]
Ahhh.
Yay! It loves us now.
[Barking.]
Awww, it's okay, Veggie Head.
That brute can't get you now.
Oh.
[chuckle.]
It's nice to have a new addition to the family.
[Vroom!.]
Huh? [New York accent.]
Ah what?! What the?! Hobos broke into the barn.
Hey! Don't you touch our things! You're hobettes? A hobo is a man's job.
Who's the human and what's he yelling about? The real question is: where are my
attack drones? [Beeping.]
Wait a minute.
Those mysterious constructions, your weird appearance, your strange jewels.
I know what you are.
You're hippies! I heard about you on AM radio.
What are you doin', comin' in here, socializin' this fine, American barn?
[Beeping.]
Ugh.
Whaaah! Oh, there they are.
Wait! Don't hurt him! But he's attacking us, and our home.
Uh, hello! How's it goin'?! Uh, how do you think? Uh, yeah We just wanted to
know what you want.
What I want? I want you hippies out of my barn! Your barn? [Rustling.]
[Jazz plays.]
There they are.
Greg got your message and we came, too.
Is that the human giving you trouble? I told you you two could use a guard dog.
[Barking.]
I guess that works.
What're you doin' to that guy up there? Just putting him down.
Uhhh! Not cool.
Greg? Andy? They know each other? This is perfect! Come on, help me chase off
these freeloaders.
They're usin' some kinda hippie mind tricks.
- Um - Who told you you could move in here and mess this whole place up? I did,
Andy.
You did? This is my parents' barn.
Um, Dad, who's this? "Dad"? You mean? No way.
Steven, this is Andy.
He's my cousin.
Andy, meet Steven.
He's my son.
Wow! It's really nice to meet you! Does that mean you're my first cousin, once
removed? - Forget that nonsense.
- Oyyy! Huah! Nyah! You call me Uncle Andy.
I'm an uncle.
I can't believe it.
Greg, ya little turd, how come you never told me? How was I supposed to?! I
haven't seen you in years! And whose fault is that? You thought you were so
much better than us, you just got in your van and drove away.
That was like two decades ago! Uncle Andy, can I get down now? Oh, sorry,
Steven.
I'm not used to holdin' nephews.
'Cause I didn't know I had one! So, uh, which one of these girls is the wife? I
gotta give her my condolences, right? [Laughs.]
Hey, come on.
What, I gotta guess, here? It's gotta be you.
I bet this useless lump needs a big girl to keep him in line.
You're not big.
I'm just sayin'.
You're tall, not, you know.
Rose is no longer with us.
Uh, wow.
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
These people are sort of like her family, so I offered to let these two stay in
the barn.
Yeah? Ah, well, that was real nice of ya.
But the barn's for the DeMayo family.
Wh-What's a DeMayo? Andy DeMayo.
Greg DeMayo.
Steven DeMayo.
We're the DeMayos.
Actually, we're, um, the Universes, now.
You space walnut! You didn't even keep the family name, but you're goin'
around, givin' family property out like candy onsome kind of candy-givin'-out
holiday? You're telling me Universe isn't a real last name?! It is a real name.
I had it changed.
Andy, look, they just really needed a place.
They're alien refugees from space and They're illegal.
aliens?! Wha? You couldn't even marry an American?! What does that matter?!
DeMayo's a much cooler name than plain old Universe.
You turned your back on your family, just so you could get in with a bunch of
weirdo, hippie, Martian immigrants?! You two, get the heck off my planet, out
of my country, and out of my barn! Reactivating attack drones.
Ah! Wait! Uncle Andy? Yeah? I'm sorry we took over the barn.
I didn't even know we had any other family to share it with.
You didn't, huh? But this barn? It means a lot to all of us.
We spent so much time together here.
Well, my family spent a lot of time here, too.
Once a year, we'd all meet up here, catch up, eat a big meal, have a good time.
Years and years of family tradition.
Oh, yeah? Well, we can do that, too.
We've got a farm here, with plenty of food.
Let's make a big, traditional meal, and eat it together.
You'll have a good time, and then, you'll have to admit they're family.
And would you kick family out of the family barn? Ahh Greg, you're lucky you
got such a cute kid.
I know he didn't get it from you.
So, you're letting them I'll give your coven a chance and eat your dinner, but
only 'cause I lost my sandwich in the Atlantic.
Now, excuse me.
I gotta go get my junk out of the plane.
You think this'll work? Maybe.
Andy's never been the type to change his mind about something, and he's really
got his longjohns in a twist.
It's gonna take a lot to calm him down.
I don't like this guy.
I don't like some ugh new Greg just showin' up outta nowhere.
Our Greg is clearly the superior one.
We're not leaving our home.
If that clod thinks he can push us around! Andy is a part of Steven's family.
We should make an effort to get on his good side.
If he's my family, then he's yours, too.
Gems don't have family.
At least, not before we came here.
So, for the sake of our family, tell us what to do.
[Ethereal tune plays.]
Let's get cookin'.
[Upbeat tune plays.]
Peridot: Okay.
Gimme the next row.
All right.
[Thud!.]
Whoa.
Your aunt is, uh, pretty strong.
She works out.
Yeah, I'll bet.
[Laughing.]
[Barking.]
[Barking.]
[Panting.]
[Barking.]
[Steven chuckles.]
[Barking continues.]
Rahh! Sorry.
Fly ball.
Unh! Yeah! This looks amazing! [Barking.]
For a vegetable garden, I'd say we're pretty fruitful.
Is it just gonna be a bunch of vegetables? [sigh.]
I shoulda figured.
You're a bunch of vegetarians! A vegetable grown by a family's love nurtures
the body and soul.
Ah, don't let 'em get to ya, Steven.
I'll getcha a stick o' pepperoni for your birthday.
[Chugging.]
[Whoosh!.]
Hmm Let's turn it down to around 2,000 degrees, for now.
Sounds puny.
I like the propeller on it.
It's like it's Andy-themed.
I bet he's gonna love this.
We're ready for the veggies now! Be over in a sec, Stu-ball.
Mm! Seems like too much, if ya ask me [Chugging.]
Awww, what have you done?! [Hyperventilating.]
Uh, Uncle Andy? Dude, what's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong, du-u-de.
Everything! Can you not see this abomination sittin' right in front of you?!
What are you talking about? It's the engine, boy.
The engine! They butchered my parents' plane and made made whatever this thing
is! It's an oven/ cooktop combo.
It's terrible! That was the heart of the legendary wings of the Daring DeMayos.
I learned to fly on this plane! No one was even using that junk.
Now, it's actually good for something.
See, that's the problem with people like you.
You think everything just belongs to you, 'cause nothing belongs to anybody,
and you take it and everything's cool.
And it ain't cool! - Andy? - I'm gonna need a moment.
I-I can't look at this right now.
- Uh - Andy, hold up! - They didn't know! - Right, I get it: in-laws.
This is going down in flames.
I'm sure Greg will turn this around.
What do you mean, you weren't technically married?! Look, Andy We gotta up our
game.
It's going to take the ultimate party to turn this around.
Like, all the best parties of all time, put together! I think that's doable.
See you in a bit! Have fu-u-u-n! Ready? [Barking.]
What's got into Pumpkin? [Whimpering.]
Whoa! Chill out, dude.
You sure I can't help you with anything? Ah, it's okay.
Uncle Andy and I got it.
Whoa! It's one peel! Aunt Deb and I usually got put on kitchen duty when the
family got together.
I've peeled a lotta potatoes in my day.
Ah, man, what's Aunt Deb been up to, lately? Suddenly, you care about Aunt Deb?
Oh, Mr.
Curiosity.
Let's see if I can cram 20 years into a sentence.
[Twinkle!.]
Uh, I'm gonna get these on the stove.
Sure.
[chuckles.]
Hey, it works.
You know, I guess it's good these plane parts are gettin' some use.
I mean, maybe recyclin' isn't so bad.
Looks like you got a new plane, anyway.
She's a good one, too.
Been all over the world in that thing.
You've been all over the world? You better believe it.
It's really somethin' else, you know? Just you and the hum of your engine up in
that thin air.
No other people, no livin' things around to, uh, keep you company.
But, you know, it's not like there's much for me down on the ground, these days
either, so.
Uh, Uncle Andy? [Horn honks.]
Your aunts are back.
[Upbeat tune plays.]
So, Andy, we heard you like marriage, so we thought "Why don't we all marry
each other?" Ta-da! And, if that's not human enough for you, we can throw in a
little being born and some dying.
We're very sorry for your marriage.
We tried to cover as many celebrations in the human life span as we could.
Nice.
Oh, boy! [Laughing.]
Okay, okay, I give up.
It's too much! [Laughs.]
All right.
Where am I sitting? Whaddya say we get right to it, huh? And, hey, if we're
throwin' all tradition out the window, anyway, why don't we start with this
gorgeous cake? Dessert before dinner.
[Laughs.]
Where are my manners? Steven, pass it to your friend.
Oh.
Where are my manners? Oh.
Where are my manners? Oh! Thank you, Lapis.
But where are my manners? Ohhh! Where are my manners? Andy.
What? You guys don't like cake? Gems don't really eat.
Well, except for Amethyst.
I'm good.
I had like, three bottles of cooking oil earlier.
Agggghhhh! That's uh all right.
That's what we forgot: more cooking oil.
And the shopping cart! We should've taken it.
We could've put it in the wall next to the truck.
That would've been stealing.
'Cause it's made out of steel? Didn't we save the Earth? We should have access
to everything on it, by right! Or at least get a discount.
You guys think you're savin' the Earth? Saving the Earth from Homeworld is its
own reward.
You know what else would be a reward? A reward! All right.
We don't want to start another Gem War at the table.
Ooh, don't start it.
[chuckling.]
What if I just came to this table and started colonizing it, 'cause I'm a
Homeworld Gem? [Laughter.]
[Gasps.]
But you can't! This table has corn on it and it's beautiful and we'll defend
it! [Laughter.]
Oh! You're right.
Now that I've spent time at the table, I can see the value of your corn!
[Laughter.]
Why don't you put that corn in a mirror for thousands of years and then see how
it feels about the table.
[Laughter.]
Really hate the table! You know what? Thank you, Steven.
Putting this meal together was a great idea.
Oh, no, I should be thanking Garnet.
She gathered up all the vegetables.
Lapis and Peridot grew them.
Thank you.
Oh, but, it was Pearl who drove us to the "store.
" Well, I have to thank Steven for cooking; the vegetables and Amethyst, for
putting out that grease fire.
And starting it.
Oh, and, thanks to Greg for lending his van.
I guess you could say we can thank everyone.
Yes.
Was everyone thanked? Raise your hand if you were thanked! [Insects buzz.]
Hey, uh, what about Andy? Hmm Thank you, Andy, for showing up! Because of you,
everyone came out here to the barn and and, now, we're all in one place
together for the first time in a while.
And it's actually pretty great.
So, cheers! Cheers! [Laughter.]
Ah.
You can have it.
The barn.
It's yours.
Did we do something wrong? I thought I said something really sentimental.
[Engine buzzing.]
No! Wait! He can't leave! Lapis.
Hmm.
[Guitar strums.]
Uhh.
What was I thinkin'? Hi, Uncle Andy! Ah! What?! What are you doin', kid?! I
thought everything was going really well.
Is something wrong? Yeah, something's wrong.
You're a mile in the sky, hangin' off a floatin' lady! Go home! [Panting.]
Why'd you leave? I'm the only one who didn't.
It was your goofball father who was the first one to hightail it outta here.
Then, after him, it was Aunt Deb.
She and her partner got the RV.
No reason to stick around, with that thing.
Grandpa moved to the Keys.
Too old to make the drive anymore.
I was the only one who tried to keep everything how it used to be.
I knew what it meant to really be a family.
And look what that got me, huh? Nothin'! Ah! No! Wait! Hold on.
Aaaaah! Ah-grrrrrrr! Lapis, throw me onto the plane.
Okay.
What?! I swear, if you throw him, I'll Wh-Whoa-oa! Unh! I'll meet you back at
the barn! Roger.
[Engine sputters.]
Whoa! You're throwin' off my balance! You're gonna bring us both down! Andy! I
love that we both eat cake! What?! And you have that cool hat! And you know how
to peel potatoes.
And you need a plane to fly.
I love the Gems, but, I'm a human, too.
I never had a chance to know that part of my family, but, now, I do.
Andy, I want to be your family.
Isn't that why you came back? [Tender tune plays.]
Ahhh! Aah! Steven, you better hold on! [Sputtering.]
Unh! Ah! Steven! Steven! Float, float, float! Apple pie, videogames, fresh
laundry.
[Upbeat tune plays.]
Andy! [Splash!.]
[Tender tune plays.]
That was a close one, Uncle Andy.
You sure are good at Do you have any idea what coulda happened to you?! What
good are you to me as family if you're? Sorry.
Look, I just ah, I'm just glad that you're safe.
It just doesn't feel fair.
Everything got so different.
I wanted everybody to stay the same, but they they just didn't.
Jeez, what am I even doin'? I got an airplane.
I could've been visitin' everybody, everywhere they went.
I could've known about you.
I guess I could've just changed, too, you know.
It's not too late.
We're here.
If you want us to be.
No! Say "clod.
" Cuh-lah-duh.
[Barking.]
[Engine buzzes.]
- Steven! - Hi-i! Andy, it's good to see you again.
- I'm sorry if - Hey, uh, you guys probably got a lotta leftovers, right? I-
I just figured I'd come back and help you with that.
You know, since you don't eat, and all.
Yes, of course.
We'll get everything in order.
Well, thanks for the barn! Hey, Andy? I'm really glad you came back.
Ah, c'mere, you goofball.
[Laughs.]
You need a haircut, son.
[Laughter.]
[Barking.]
Pumpkin! Hey, you got some leftovers for me, too, you little you little freak
o' nature, there? Byahhh! [Laughter.]
That's, uh That's gross.
[Eerie music plays.]

**** Three Gems and a Baby ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in #

It's amazing! The snow just keeps falling and falling! I'm glad you're staying
here with us, Dad.
Yeah, me, too, buddy! It's way too cold to stay in the van during this
blizzard.
Besides, the heater in the van hasn't worked since I got that sweet mini-disc
player installed, which I do not regret.
I've never seen it snow like this before.
That's not entirely true.
- Really? - You mean back when [Chuckling.]
Oh! That was about 14 years ago! There was a snow storm happening just like
this around then.
14 years.
Hey, I'm 14 years! That's right, little man.
You were only a few months old.
And it was snowing so hard, I thought we were going to become Snowman and
Snowman Jr.
, son of Snowman.
But Vidalia was out of town visiting family, so she let us crash at her place
for a while.
It was the first time you Dad!! I'm not that far away, Steven.
Don't forget our arrangement.
Good gravy.
That's what you get for raising me to love music.
Luckily, I have a song for this story already.
Greg: # I could never be, I could never be # I could never be ready for this I
could never be, I could never be I could never be ready Things start, and
things end And isn't it lovely in theory, but I could never be, I could never
be I could never be ready [Music continues.]
[Yawns.]
[Crying.]
Hey, little Schtu-ball.
You're doing a lot of dancing in there.
You want to get out of there and show me your moves? Hey, now.
You unbuttoned all your buttons I buttoned up! [Blowing raspberry.]
[Giggling.]
Let's get you buttoned back up.
Ookie-pookie! There! Huh? What's Does your gem need to breathe? Hmm.
How about this? [Knock on door.]
Oh! Um, hey, y'all! - Hello! - Yo, Greg, check it out! We brought gifts for
Lil' Rose! Amethyst, we've gone over this.
Steven is a Human baby.
And Steven is Not Rose.
[Door closes.]
Can I get you guys anything? We've got water, old plates, uh How about some
tea? No.
We're just here to drop off these gifts.
Right! Sure.
Garnet: Here you go.
[Cooing.]
You'll probably have to open that up for him.
It's just a box, made to look like it's been carefully wrapped.
[Cooing.]
- Ta-da! - Whoa! Thanks, Garnet, but I don't think he needs this.
Oh, he'll need it in the future.
[Laughs.]
Let's open mine next! Wow! Diapers! This is so practical! Wait.
Are these adult diapers?! They're way too big for him.
So tell him to make himself bigger! You can do that, right, Lil' Greg? Greg:
You can call him Steven.
That's the name Rose and I liked the most.
Well, whatever you call him, he'll need this.
Uh, thanks.
This some kind of kid's book? Oh.
A dictionary.
Obviously, it's the best gift for a being that can't yet communicate.
Well, maybe you guys could use it to look up what a baby is.
These gifts are great, but Steven's just too young for this stuff.
Nowadays, he's really into this.
Carabiner [Jingling.]
Carabiner! [Laughing.]
Whoa! He loves it! Hey, Lil' Steven! [Giggling.]
Hmm.
He's certainly captivated with those things.
Well, next time, we'll just bring a big box of keys for Steven.
[Laughter.]
Whoa! [Gasps.]
- Ooh! - Buh?! What's happening to him?! It's Rose! Is that possible? Is he
gonna turn into a laser?! Relax, y'all.
I got it all figured out.
Rose is trying to shape-shift back to her old self! - What?! - She can't shape-
shift because she's trapped in a baby! - Trapped in a baby? - [Giggling.]
Rose? Rose, it's me.
It's Pearl! Are you in there? Glow twice for yes! [Giggling.]
Baby, please.
I'm trying to talk to Rose.
Rose hasn't shape-shifted, and she isn't trapped.
Steven is a fusion.
[Babbling.]
Rose could be trying to unfuse.
Whatever Steven is, something's happening, and I What can I do to help?! Well,
what do you do with a human baby when it glows? First off, human babies don't
glow.
And letter number "B" what if they do?! Okay, Vidalia has some books on babies
I've been reading.
They'll help us figure something out.
[Sighs.]
Calm down.
You got this.
Guys, if this is anything like a fever, then we should Uh, guys? Guys?! You
kidnapped me?! Yep! Some of our actions were a bit regrettable.
At the time, we thought it'd be better to handle things our way.
Nah.
We straight-up 'napped you.
[Engine starts.]
[Tires squeal.]
Steven! My van! Give me back my babies! He looks mad.
He'll thank us later.
Greg was doing his best up to this point.
But the situation has changed.
Steven is clearly a gem.
Good thing we left without any explanation.
All right, Rose, we saw that glow.
So why are you still a baby? Is it really fun or something? Garnet, hold me!
All right, I get it.
[Sighs.]
This rules.
But it's been so long like months! That's longer than I was a toilet.
Come on, Rose! [Scoffs.]
You have to change back! Baby.
Normal.
Baby.
Normal.
Baby [Giggling.]
[Groans.]
It's so easy! Why can't she do it? Because it's not shape-shifting.
It's fusion.
Steven, I understand Greg is part of you, and you don't want to unfuse in front
of him.
That would be very rude.
But he's not here now.
It's just us! You can take a little break.
Here.
I will, too.
[Whimpering.]
[Crying.]
I'm here! You know me! You know them, too! I don't understand! Steven! Steven!
How am I gonna catch up with them? [Children laughing.]
Dog.
Sled.
Dog, sled.
Dog, sled.
Hey! Hey, you kids! [Steven crying.]
Everyone, calm down.
[Steven stops crying.]
Look, we can all see her.
She's right there! She just can't reform because she has this baby around her.
Rose, I know you're in there.
I can let you out.
We'll be together again.
[Giggling.]
I can't.
I can't! She wanted this so much.
I just don't understand why! "Everything should grow, and everything should
change.
And And isn't it so great how it comes so naturally to humans.
" Well, it's not natural for us! [Sighs.]
It's not naturalfor me.
It will be for him.
What about Rose? This isn't about Rose.
From now on, everything has to be about Steven.
[Dog barking.]
He-l-l-l-l-p! Help! Ugh.
Thanks.
[Cooing.]
Hey, wait a minute! Why did you take Steven on a joyride in the middle of a
blizzard? What's the big idea? There wasn't really a big idea.
Just a bunch of small ideas that never came together.
My apologies, Greg.
We thought we knew what Steven was.
But we didn't.
Honestly, I'm not sure if I do, either.
I never glowed when I was a kid.
We never were kids.
[Giggling.]
I don't know how we're going to figure this out, but I think we'll have a
better shot if we do it together.
[Dog continues barking.]
[Kettle whistling.]
Wow.
You guys were wrong about everything.
Well, that was a [Chuckles.]
A really long time ago, wasn't it? Cut us some slack, will ya? We couldn't have
known what to do, even me.
Especially me.
No, I mean about changing and growing, and how it doesn't come naturally to
you? But look at you now! I know you'll never stop missing Mom, but I bet she
would've loved this.
I do.
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
It wasn't such a big deal when that teenaged girl kidnapped Steven.
That was his babysitter.
She took him to the park.
You really scared her when you threw that jungle gym at her.
[Laughter.]

****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e10 Episode Script ******
**** Steven's Dream ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # - Garnet: # believe in # - #
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # Greg: Steven?
Steven? Steven! [Eerie music plays.]
[Cow moos.]
You okay, bud? You fell asleep during the movie.
I was gonna let you sleep, you looked so cute, but then you started crying, and
that was less cute.
[Chuckles.]
No, I'm fine.
I don't know why I was crying.
My dream wasn't really sad [Yawns.]
Oh, gee, look at the time and my classy new watch! Let's get you home, bud.
Aw, you didn't miss much.
Turns out they were abducting cows 'cause they needed milk for their cereal
planet! Dad, before you go, can I ask you something? Yeah, of course.
Did mom ever talk to you about Pink Diamond? There were some things your mom
didn't like to talk about.
I never pressed her for details.
Why not? Rose and I talked about tons of important stuff music, comic books,
getting sand between your toes you know, feelings.
We both made a lot of mistakes when we were young.
I thought disco was coming back, she started a war.
I think she felt like she had to confess everything to me, but I told her, "The
past is the past.
All that matters to me is who you are now.
" And who she was, was an incredible, loving being.
'Night, Dad.
'Night, Steven.
[Sighs.]
I'm here again.
Well, I guess I can look around.
What is this place? What's what is Whoa! Huh? Ah! Sorry, I'll clean that up
later! When you told me about your dream, I thought it sounded familiar.
Steven: [Gasps.]
That's it the Palan-kwin.
Actually, it's pronounced "palan-keen.
" [Energy whirs.]
It's the Gems! They've gotta know about this thing! - Whee! - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo!
- Yo.
Hey, do you know anything about this thing? Hmm.
Steven, you deserve to know the truth, and the truth is I have no idea what
that is.
I've never seen it before in my life.
Excuse me, Amethyst.
Allow me.
[Inhales.]
Uh W-well it appears to be an illustration in some kind of journal.
Steven: Come on, you know what I mean.
I had a dream where I saw this thing! Connie and I were wondering if maybe
Steven, why don't you and Connie You can't go there! Why not? Yeah, why not?
[Sighs.]
I thought you were going to tell me everything from now on.
Oh, Steven, we Does this have something to do with Pink Diamond? I already know
mom shattered her, so what is it about this that you can't tell me?! Please,
you're making Pearl very upset.
No! I'm very upset! We're not going.
Rose never wanted you to see this place.
Rose wanted? [Growls.]
What about what I want?! I'm sick of everyone lying to me! Rose is my mom! Out
of anyone, don't I deserve to know the truth?! This isn't the time.
I don't care! I want to go there now! Steven! I'm sorry.
I I shouldn't have brought the book.
Yes, you should have brought it! It's lucky something has some information that
I don't have to get out of them! Connie, I need to borrow this book.
Okay, just be careful.
I gotta return it to the library in a week.
Thanks.
Wait, Steven, where are you Garnet: Steven, don't go.
You have to trust me.
I don't understand, Garnet.
At least you're usually honest with me.
I really want to be, but if I tell you why you shouldn't go, you'll only want
to go more.
What?! Well, now I really want to go! [Scoffs.]
I shouldn't have said that.
You can't go because I can't go with you! Why not? - Garnet, why not?! - I I'm
scared.
I-I-I can't get near her.
Ah, "her!" Her, who? Ah, shoot! Now I've made it more interesting.
Steven, please! Just stay here for me.
I won't.
[Sighs.]
I know.
[Greg snoring.]
[Banging on door.]
Huh? Dad, I need your help! Is everything o There's this place I saw in a dream
and it's real but the Gems won't tell me anything about it! It has something to
do with Pink Diamond.
I know you didn't want to get involved with mom's past, but I want to know the
truth! Doesn't that matter at all? Of course it does! Really? Let me see that.
And the Gems won't take you? No.
Well, I know a guy who will! Andy: So the Universes are going to Korea.
Steven: Thank you for the ride, Uncle Andy! Ah, it's no problem.
Like they say, family helps family find mysterious ancient artifacts.
It's gonna be very serious work.
No time for fun at all.
Well, isn't there time for a little fun? Hmm [Upbeat music plays.]
Kamsahamnida! Huh? What's the hurry? This is it.
You sure this is the place? Yeah.
It's hard to explain, but I can feel it.
Hmm, sure is pretty here.
So does any of this look familiar to you? Steven? Whoa, you okay? It's
happening again! I'm fine.
Let's keep going.
Come on, let's take a break.
I think this mountain's really messing you up.
No, Dad.
This can only mean we're getting closer! Come on! Look! Greg: This feels
familiar.
Dad, help me jump the fence.
Oh, boy.
We're doing this.
[Grunts.]
Oof! Oh, your dad really can't jump fences like he used to.
Dad, look! This is it! But it's different? In my dream, it was all broken down
and pink.
It's in perfect condition.
Maybe it got a paint job? Blue Diamond: Oh, Pink.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I should have done more.
Yellow says it'll all be over soon.
I wonder what you would think.
This is your planet, after all.
I still think it is.
Steven, do you know her? Whoa, buddy! My dreams I was seeing through her eyes.
I've been crying her tears! What are you doing over there? I thought I heard
someone.
Don't worry, I'll handle this.
I think we're not alone.
[Gasps.]
Hey! Uh, nice day out, huh? I I didn't see you there.
What's, uh what's up? Blue Diamond: Pearl? My diamond, I've found a native.
Oh, uh, yeah! I'm from here, all right! Annyeonghaseyo, your highness.
Bring it here.
[Whispering.]
Dad, no! How curious.
I'm impressed by humanity's ability to survive in the wild.
What a strange planet.
Where else would a being as fragile as a human live, while a being as powerful
as a diamond perish? This is where it happened where she was broken.
Were you close? Very.
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
I know how hard it is to move on when you've lost someone.
You do? I lost someone very important to me, too.
I miss her every single day, and I think about her all the time.
But she's never coming back.
That feeling can be so hard to be okay with.
I'm surprised that a human being is capable of understanding how I feel.
It's a shame.
There's a geo-weapon incubating in your planet that will destroy everything
shortly.
But you don't deserve that, do you? Geo-weapon, huh? You know, I really
shouldn't be here, but I'm glad I came back one last time.
I can save one last piece of her legacy.
Oh, yeah? Oof! Dad! That's a big arm! [Gasps.]
[Groans.]
Put me down, please! Oh, whoa! Put me down, your highness! Whoa! Whoa! Dad,
Dad! Stop! [Grunts.]
Dad.
Steven, I'm I'm sorry! Garnet! I saw you come here.
I saw Blue Diamond on Earth.
I saw her see me and find all of us.
I couldn't be here with you.
She took my dad! It's all my fault.
I should have listened to you! What are we gonna do, Garnet? We're going to
space.
We're going to get him back.
[Eerie music plays.]

**** Adventures in Light Distortion ****
1 - # We # - # Are the Crystal # - # Gems # - # we'll always save the day # and
if you think we can't we'll always find a way - # that's why the people # - #
of this world # believe in Garnet - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # And Steven!
This can't be happening.
- Steven, you're back.
- Hey, Steve-O.
We're so sorry about earlier.
Forget that! We have to catch up with her! - What? - Who? - Blue Diamond.
- Blue Diamond? - Oh, oh, on Earth? - Holy smokes! They're all coming out of
the woodwork.
Amethyst, turn into a chair.
I-I need to sit down.
She took Dad! She alien abducted him, and it's all my fault! She took Greg? Our
Greg? What other Greg is there? How are we gonna get him back? What does she
even want him for? To eat him? To put him in a zoo? Wait.
That might be it.
She's gonna eat him?! What? No.
But there was a No, no.
It couldn't possibly still exist.
Not since we That's right.
Pink Diamond's insidious human zoo.
What? During her reign on Earth, Pink Diamond stole humans from their families
as trophies of her conquests.
You got to be kidding.
Oh, no.
It was very serious.
When I still served Homeworld, I saw it myself.
A private menagerie deep in space.
Humans in captivity.
We were never able to rescue them.
We had no way to get to them after the war.
But that was over 5,000 years ago.
You really think Greg's there? Steven, Blue Diamond wanted him alive? Yes, yes!
She liked him! I can't think of anywhere else she'd put him if she wanted to
keep him.
That is if the zoo's still there.
It's our only chance.
But how are we going to get there? With the Roaming Eye.
The Ruby ship? That's right.
We're going into space, and we're not coming back without Greg.
Let's see.
Your pulsar trackers are tracking pulsars.
The atmosphere shield seems functional, but you're not going to need that in
space, obviously.
Make sure it's safe for Steven.
He should be fine, but I think I should go in and change the system preferences
the Rubies set.
How do you feel about green lights instead of red? There's no time for that! If
it works, let's just do it already! Sorry, Connie, but we just can't wait.
Dad's in trouble, and we need to go into space to get him back.
There's no time.
We're going right now.
Just protect Beach City for me while we're gone.
So, if I input the coordinates, it will take us right there? It's a little more
complicated than that.
These aren't your era one light kites.
You're gonna be pretty much bending reality if you turn on the gravity engine.
Come to think of it, I should really change the ruby preferences on that, too.
So what? So it's red! Come on, come on! We got to go! Rubies aside, will it
fly? Short answer, yes.
Okay, let's go.
Lapis, Peridot, stay here.
You'll have to protect Beach City if something happens while we're gone.
You can count on us.
Don't worry, Dad.
We're on our way.
I hope he got to see some of this.
There's enough out here for a whole album about the cosmos.
Oh, oh! - Space turbulence.
- Oh-oh.
Sweet moves.
Hold on.
All right, how much further till we get to Sorry, Rubies.
We should really do something about them.
We can pick them up on the way back.
Dad comes first.
How much longer till we get there? Well, at our current speed, we should be
reaching the human zoo in approximately 70 human years.
Just in time for Greg's 110th anniversary of being alive.
Pearl, my dad's not healthy enough to live that long.
Uhdo you think he'll be able to make it to 109? Before we left, Peridot did
mention a gravity engine.
Oh, yeah.
She said it bends reality.
Oh, I'm sure she was exaggerating.
It probably just alters the definition of speed by manipulating space time, but
what effect will that have on organic matter? It might flatten Steven's body -
into a pancake of skin and bones.
- Ew.
Bones are gross.
You have bones in your bedroom.
That's different.
Those are my bones.
If being a pancake means saving my dad, then bring on the syrup.
Steven.
Steven? Are you okay? I'm fine.
I think I just blacked out.
Um, are you guys okay? You tell me.
Uh, no, we're not okay! Uh, why do you guys look like that? The gravity warp
seems to be affecting our bodies.
Please tell me this lasts forever.
Our bodies are made of light, and usually they form a mass dependent on the air
pressure and the level of gravity in the environment.
But we're in a situation where the normal laws of physics don't apply.
Who cares? It's funny.
In what way is this funny?! So, you guys aren't doing this on purpose? Can't
you shapeshift back? Hold on.
Huh, check it out.
Puma cub.
The ship seems to be putting out some kind of energy, keeping us in this shape.
Oh, I know the problem.
You do? Peridot said the ship was calibrated for Rubies.
It must be making you all Ruby sized.
Ugh! Why doesn't she ever tell us anything? This is why we don't listen to her.
Maybe I can change the settings.
Whoa.
No.
Nope.
Sorry! This isn't working.
Try adjusting it manually.
Whoa.
Um, maybe this one? Okay, so that does that.
Maybe this one.
Why is this so complicated? Hey, Steven.
This is getting a little weird, even for me.
I think I found the off switch.
Guys! W-What did I do? Amethyst? Garnet? Peal? Where are you? What happened?
Are you cracked? Amethyst is usually back by now.
Oh, no.
That's the zoo.
Uh, we're gonna smash right into it if we don't slow down.
Come on, Steven.
You can do it.
It's okay.
The gems are gonna be fine.
They got to be fine.
Dad's gonna be fine, too.
It doesn't seem like it right now, but later, we're gonna laugh.
If I could just stop the ship.
It isn't going to stop.
There's no fixing this.
It's all my fault.
I rushed us.
I pushed us into making stupid mistakes.
It didn't have to be this way.
I didn't have to not listen to Garnet.
I didn't have to go to Korea.
Dad.
I didn't have to get you taken away forever by Blue Diamond.
I-I wasn't trying to be selfish.
I just wanted to know what was going on for myself for once.
But now I lost everyone.
Dad! Dad! I want my dad! I just want my dad.
You're back! Where'd you go? I was so worried! I think in your attempt to fix
our bodies, you may have accidentally shut off the calibration altogether.
Our light-composed forms couldn't keep up with a ship moving faster than the
speed of light.
So you were just lagging behind the ship this whole time? Yeah.
Don't worry about it too much.
Amethyst liked it.
I never thought I could stretch so far.
I think I kind of phased through a planet.
Yeah.
Uh, yo, Ste-man.
You heard Garnet.
We're totally fine, dude.
I-I was pushing so hard.
I I just wanted to get Dad back so much.
I-I almost wrecked the mission.
This whole thing is my fault.
Steven, you didn't kidnap Greg.
Blue Diamond did.
Whoa.
Do you guys see that? What you did got us to the zoo.
Yeah? And only 70 human years ahead of schedule.
I'll see you really soon, Dad.
I hope.

**** Gem Heist ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # The Human Zoo.
I can't believe it still exists.
Dad's got to be in there.
We just have to find him and bust him out.
[Gasps.]
Those Gems.
Amethyst guards.
Right.
Like we could just waltz up as an ownerless Pearl, a Fusion, and and you.
We just need disguises.
I'll be Esteban Universedad.
Steven, it doesn't matter what your name is.
We're all going to stand out.
We won't stand out if we play the roles we were made for.
Ruby! Sapphire! Okay everybody, hear her out.
Today, I'm a Sapphire traveling with my Ruby guard Hm! And my personal Pearl.
Mm-hmm! Esteban, I've brought you as an offering for the zoo.
Pobrecito Esteban! Uh, what about me? You're accompanying me as extra muscle.
Muscle like them? Exactly.
But I've never even seen another Amethyst before.
What do I do? What if I say something wrong? Just look the part.
You're new and we're rusty, but we just have to sell this long enough to find
Greg.
- Is this really going to work? - No.
- Uh? - Eh Just stick together, play it straight.
Let's change the future.
You'll never cage me, ya rock heads! State your purpose.
I'm here to make a delivery to the Human Zoo.
Bad news the Human Zoo shut down, which means we'll just have to throw you into
space.
Ha! Look.
It believed me.
[Both laugh.]
What are you doing? Nothing, Holly Blue Agate.
Nothing, Holly Blue Agate.
[Gasps.]
[Grunts.]
Why didn't you tell me there was a Sapphire here? What have you miscreants been
saying to them? Nothing, Holly.
You'll have to forgive them.
[Chuckles.]
They're from Earth.
Ahem! Apologize.
- Forgive us.
- Forgive us.
Ow! Forgive us, Your Clarity.
Forgive us, Your Clarity.
No use dwelling on the past.
I've brought a new human for the collection.
How unprecedented nothing for millennia and then two humans back-to-back! Well,
it's probably for the best.
That first one wasn't in the best condition.
- [Gasps.]
Dad! That's him! - Shh! Oh, they're incessant barking! What is it saying?
[Chuckles.]
The other one was loud too.
And all that thrashing about.
I'm sure Blue Diamond will want to thank you personally, but you just missed
her.
[Both sigh.]
Amethyst, take this human to the Wait! The thing is we've traveled so far, and
it would be a shame to leave so quickly.
Perhaps you'd grant us a tour of the facility? I would be honored.
Right this way, Your Grand Clarity.
Amethysts are to stay and guard the door.
Uh, but The door.
Does your Pearl always walk next to you? [Laughs nervously.]
I'll just be right here.
Hmm.
Chatty.
This facility originally belonged to Pink Diamond and houses and staffs the
otherwise useless Quartzes she produced on what was her colony.
But Blue Diamond and her trusted Agate that's me have been maintaining this
place since the dawn of Era 2.
Is she going to do it, or should I say something? Oh.
Pearl, the door.
Hm? Oh! Right, right.
I got it.
You are so patient with her.
How do you do it? As a Sapphire, I know it will happen eventually.
[Beep.]
That will be all.
Sorry.
Hang in there.
Do keep up, Pearl.
Ugh.
The bottom half of this structure is devoted entirely to specimen containment.
Apparently, humans don't take well to captivity.
But once you understand their needs, they're easy to control.
It's tragic that Pink Diamond's existence in this universe ended up being so
finite.
But what a selfless act for Blue Diamond to step forward and spend her own time
and energy preserving this place in Pink Diamond's memory.
It's a real testament to Blue Diamond's merciful and giving nature, don't you
think? Uh, of course.
Argh.
Hold it together, Ruby.
Our roles, remember? Gotta Esteban it.
And here, of course, is the human disposal chute.
Wha H-How do get in the zoo? Oh, there it goes again with its hilarious noises.
So, how do you get in the zoo? Excellent question, Your Grand Clarity.
One the rare occasion that we would need to enter the containment area, we
would do so via this service door.
Dad.
That door's how we get to Dad.
We just need to come up with a distraction.
Got it! As one-way access point, there are no risks of an escape.
In fact, it's only been used once for a human Explosion! Pardon me? Uh.
I just remembered I left the gravity engine idling.
Sorry, my Sapphire, I'm so forgetful and disposable.
What? a foreseen turn of events.
Yes, it is going to overheat and explode.
The damage will be massive.
My word! I don't know why anyone trusts Rubies with those ships.
This is what happens.
If we hurry, we can disable the engine before any damage is done.
I should only take five minutes, so everyone be on your best behavior.
Hm? Oh.
This way, Your Clarity.
Although, I'm sure you don't need my guidance.
Argh! I can't believe all that stuff about Blue Diamond being merciful! She's a
shatterer! She yelled at Sapphire! She hates Fusion! And love! I know, Ruby,
but we don't have much time! We have to open this door! Right, right.
Pearl, open it! Of course.
What else am I good for? It's different than the other ones.
[Beep.]
[Beep.]
Aha! [Beep.]
I actually can't figure this out at all.
What?! But Pearl, you're our hacker.
We don't have time for this! Steven, help me open the door! Okay.
And Pearl, hack faster! [Grunting.]
[Screaming.]
[Sighs.]
Sapphire: I am so glad we're almost back! I was really enjoying the tour! Yes,
I can tell by the tone of your voice.
Thank you so much again for averting that crisis.
[Both gasp.]
What is going on? Oh, well, I'm sure there's a reasonable Did you see the
Amethyst that did this? [All sigh.]
Really, we have guests.
Holly Blue Agate, we have important news for you! We do not run or shout in
these hallways! I'm sorry, i-it's just that How am I supposed to know what
you're saying when you're mumbling? Uh, I'm sorry, Holly Blue Agate, it's just
Blue Diamond is on her way! Oh, my stars! She's back already? You two, best
behavior! Shoulders squared! Minds cleared! Backs straight! And surely, Blue
Diamond will want to thank you personally for this special delivery, Your Grand
Clarity.
Yes, I suppose she will.
Well don't just stand there, you useless chunks of earth, make yourself useful
and escort that human to the assimilation bay! But the tour.
Oh, Your Clarity, you flatter me.
But we really must get ready.
Our Diamond will be here at any moment! Let me go, you bigger Amethyst! Ha.
These newer humans are so spunky.
In you go! [Machine whirs.]
[Music.]
What the Uh Huh? Ah.
Oomph! Bleh.
Huh? Mm! Bleh.
Mm! Hey! [Grunts.]
Nope! I can do that myself.
I'll just find my dad without pants.
[Coughs.]
Ugh.
Loin cloths.
[Groans.]
Okay, what else, huh? What else you got for me? I'm on that dad-mission
adrenalin rush and ready for whatever space junk you have next.
Futuristic cattle prods, human horseshoes whatever you got, come and get me!
Aah! Aah! [Coughs.]
Huh? What the What is this place? A-And where's Dad? [Eerie music.]

**** The Zoo ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Rumbling.]
Ugh! [Coughing.]
Where am I now? - Dad? - Huh? Steven? Dad, it's you! Steven! My little man!
Dad! When Blue Diamond took you, I got so scared.
And then the Gems said you might be in some horrible human zoo all chained up
to a wall doing tricks for peanuts.
[Sobs.]
Hey, hey, it's okay, schtu-ball.
Your old man's perfectly fine.
Wait, how'd you even get out here? We got on a Gem ship from Earth.
I'll tell you about it on the way home.
I got separated from the Gems.
We got to find them and bust you out of here.
Well, you're not gonna get out that way.
I've already tried.
What? Well, there might be another way out if we can find it.
Wy-Six: Ga-reg! Who is that with you? Is this a new friend, Ga-reg? Wy-Six,
Jay-Ten, this is Let me have my dad back already! Hey, don't be like that.
Relax.
These people have treated me so well since I got here.
Wha? Greetings, greetings.
- Wow.
- Hello, Ga-reg.
- Wow, a new small friend.
- Ga-reg.
Everyone, this is Steven.
He's my son.
Uh, hi.
All: Hi.
Thanks for braiding my dad's hair.
Steven, these people are the descendants of humans brought here by Gems
thousands of years ago.
They've never seen the Earth before.
Isn't that wild? Ste-van, Ga-reg has told stories of you.
"The bits, the bits!" That's you, right? All: The bits, the bits, the bits!
Come on, say it.
Let's get out of here.
We came across a door that leads into the zoo, but we couldn't open it from the
other side.
Let's find it and try to open it from in here.
A door? Really? All right.
Let's find it tonight.
It'll be easier to look for it after the routine.
[Earrings chime.]
Little voice: Greeting, everyone.
It's time to start the daily routine.
Please enjoy your meal during this designated eating period.
Who was that? Wy-Six: Ste-van does not know what a little voice is.
Just like Ga-reg when he first arrived.
[Laughter.]
Our little voices guide us through life here.
[Earrings chime.]
You all must be hungry now.
- Yes, yes.
- We are.
Um, Dad? Don't worry, Steven.
We'll get out of here.
But for now, let's just play along.
Here you go, Ga-reg.
Oh, thank you.
Ste-van, today the fruit is purple.
Are you enjoying the food? All: Oh, yes.
How is the food? Is it good? Yes.
It is delicious.
Now it's time to play.
[Laughter.]
Hup! Whoa! Um Now, everyone, reach up like you're going to touch outer space.
That's it.
Reach up high.
Wasn't that fun? I have not had that much fun since yesterday! It's time to
stop and smell the flowers.
What if I don't want to smell the flowers? Why wouldn't you want to do that?
Time to clean up, everyone.
Let's all take a refreshing bath.
[Laughter.]
Ahh.
Watch my splash, Ga-reg! [Chuckles.]
Nice one! Ga-reg, watch mine! Those are the tiniest splashes I've ever seen.
Watch this.
Hey, Wy-Six, you ever heard of a cannonball? [Chuckles.]
I've never heard it.
Tell me what it is.
Check this out.
I'll show you.
Cannonball! [Laughs.]
- Cannonball! - Cannonball! Wouldn't you like to clean off in the pool? All
right, all right.
Wy-Six: Yeah! Cannonball! Hey, you hanging in there? I can't believe this.
They're all so happy.
It's like they don't even know that they're trapped here.
Well, of course they don't.
They've never been anywhere else.
They love it here.
I mean, look at this place.
Can you blame them? They've got everything they need, and they never have to
worry about a thing.
I guess you're right.
Hmm? [Earrings chime.]
And now it's time to say good night.
[Yawns.]
Good night, everyone.
Sweet dreams.
[Yawns.]
Geez, I sure am tired from doing a whole lot of nothing.
Well, good night, schtu-ball.
Ahh.
Dad.
Now's our chance to get out.
Man, little voice has really got me on that zooman sleep schedule.
[Grunts.]
Oh.
Is that It's the door.
Great.
How do we get it open? [Grunting.]
- Ga-reg! - Oh! - Ste-van! - Huh? So you're the ones making the noise.
What are you doing? Is it a game? Can we play, too? It's not a game.
We need to get this door open.
What is a door? Like, this part of the wall but open.
[Laughs.]
Walls don't open.
They're walls.
There is a story of an opening wall.
A very long time a go, a Gem came through a wall hole to help someone who was
hurt.
What do you mean hurt? I don't know.
I don't know what hurt is.
I know what hurt is! Together: You do? Um, it's like when you feel bad.
Bad? Yes, like, the opposite of good.
[Sighs.]
If that's the only way out, then, Dad, slug me in the face.
What?! I'm not gonna hit you! It's our ticket out of here.
One of us has to get hurt.
Okay, well, then you hit me.
You sure? Yeah.
I'll take one for the team.
[Grunting.]
Come on, give me all you got.
I can take it.
[Grunting.]
[Grunts.]
[Groans.]
Cannonball! Uh, how was that? Good.
Anyone coming? Doesn't look like it.
Should I try it again? There won't be anything left to rescue if you do.
What do we do now? [Earrings chime.]
Whatever she says.
It is time for the choosening.
Please gather around the circle of choosening.
Ste-van, Ga-reg, the choosening will start soon.
Come with us.
It's it's finally time! [Laughter.]
Ga-reg, step into the circle with us.
Is it somebody's birthday? Ste-van, wait here until the choosening is complete.
The choosening is a very special event to us.
We're glad to have you with us at such a wonderful time.
Glad to be here.
Let the choosening begin.
U12, please step into the center of the circle.
- F3 - Huh? [Laughs.]
please step into the center of the circle.
You have been choosened for each other.
Wait a second.
Is this some kind of matchmaking thing?! [Groans.]
There's always a catch to these utopias.
Ga-reg, whoever is choosen for you will be very lucky.
Jay-Ten, please step into the center of the circle.
Oh, boy.
Steven, help me.
Don't worry, Dad.
You're new here, so maybe you won't get choosened.
- Right.
- Ga-reg.
Please step into the center of the circle.
Hold on, maybe there's been a mistake.
Ga-reg, Jay-Ten is waiting for you.
[All cheering.]
I see what is going on here.
You do? You are just shy! - Huh? - Do not worry about it.
[Laughs.]
Now touch hands.
Hold on! This isn't how it works on Earth! I don't want to be told who to be
choosened with.
Ga-reg, this makes no sense.
Why wouldn't you want to be choosened? Look, back on Earth, there was no voice
to tell you who to be with.
It was your own decision.
My mom and dad didn't get together because someone told them to.
They spent time getting to know one another and fell in love.
They choosened each other 'cause that's what they choosed.
Hmm, I see.
If that's how it's done on Earth, then I choose Ga-reg.
And I also choose Ga-reg.
[Indistinct talking.]
Wait! I get a say in this, too.
You're all very nice, and I'm flattered, and yes, you get to choose whoever you
want, but I also get to say that I choose umnone of you.
[Sobbing.]
[All sobbing.]
Whoa! Hey, don't cry.
You can choose someone else.
I feel not good.
I feel bad.
Could this be is this hurt? Why would Ga-reg hurt us? Take this hurt away.
I choosen [grunts.]
to take my dad and run away.
[Panting.]
Watch out for that oof! [Groans.]
I haven't broken this many hearts since I had all my hair.
[Door warbles.]
Aah! [Sobbing.]
Hey, get back here.
This is nuts.
[Sobbing.]
Just come down! Let's talk about it.
I'll never choosen again! Sure you will.
Hey, that door's still open.
Steven: This might be our only chance.
[Panting.]
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Put us down! You two are in big trouble.
[Eerie music.]

**** That Wil Be All ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in

These the ones? [Laughter.]
Amethyst: Steven! Greg! [Grunting.]
They found me out! Amethyst! You won't believe what I've been through.
These Amethysts, they're really, really great! What?! [Laughter.]
[Laughing.]
Your faces! You were right! That was priceless! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I had to!
[Chuckles.]
What are you wearing? Greg! This is a good look for you.
What is going on? These Amethysts, they're all from Earth! They're from the
Prime Kindergarten! Wait! Hey, 8XL! Yeah? You guys, I'm an 8! Tell them.
Tell them! The amethyst under me never popped out.
We were all waiting, and pfft nothing.
I'm 8XM! Facet 5, cut 8XM that's me! - This is 8XG, this is 8XH.
- I'm J.
Ah, geez! Sorry! I'm worse than Holly Blue! Aren't we all? [Laughter.]
Prime, prime, prime.
You Amethysts are so cliquey.
Skinny's a Jasper! There are Gems here from the Beta Kindergarten, too! Hey,
where's Carnelian? Celebrating.
I'm not the shortest anymore! [Amethyst and Carnelian Laugh.]
This is unreal.
Hey! Please, if you don't mind me asking, we really need your help.
We came in with Sapphire, Ruby, and Pearl, we've got to find them and get out
of I'll only be a moment.
What are you all doing in here?! Get to your stations! Even you hideous off-
color betas! Get out of your cubbies and into your places! It's the least you
can do for the Diamond that kept your worthless, sorry Gems in service! That's
right Blue is back already! Now go pretend your filthy vein of Quartz is
capable of gratitude! Go, go, go! [All panting.]
Disperse! My Diamond is waiting! Run! Just run! I'll find you! Go! [Both
panting.]
Who bubbled all these Gems? Greg: Wow! It's kind of like a birthday party in
here.
[Gasps.]
Oh, no! - We got to hide! - Huh? Pearl, close the door.
[Sighs.]
[Door opens.]
Please tell me you're joking.
You only just left, and you're already back? Yellow! W-What are you doing here?
I'm here to bring you back to reality, Blue.
I'm fine.
Just leave me alone.
It's been thousands of years, Blue, and you still can't bring yourself to
destroy these Gems? She was shattered by a Rose Quartz! The entire cut of Gem
deserves the same fate! But they were hers.
They should be wiped out of existence, not kept safe in bubbles! Yellow, she
made them.
This is all we have left of her these Gems, this place, and the Earth.
I thought we agreed we need to put that planet and this whole debacle behind
us.
Why can't you just let me grieve? You can't keep coming here forever! Why not?
[Sighs.]
Pearl, do something.
Sing for her.
Make her feel better.
Yes, my Diamond! Ahem.
- Ahem! - Uh oh.
Aah haa haa, aah haa haa Aah haa haa haa haa haa haa Aah haa haa, aah haa haa
Aah haa haa haa haa haa haa haa haaaaaa Why would you want to be here? What do
you ever see here? That doesn't make you feel worse than you do? And tell me,
what's the use of feeling, Blue? Why would you want to employ her subjects That
destroyed her? Why keep up her silly zoo? Oh, tell me What's the use of
feeling, Blue? An army has a use, they can go and fight a war A Sapphire has a
use, she can tell you what it's for An Agate terrifies, a Lapis terraforms
Where's their Diamond when they need her, Blue? You've got to be a leader, Blue
Yes, of course, we still love her And we're always thinking of her But now
there's nothing we can do So tell me What's the use of feeling? What's the use
of feeling? What's the use of feeling, Blue? Ohh How can you stand to be here
with it all? Here with it all Drowning in all this regret? Wouldn't you rather
forget her? Ohhh Won't it be grand to get rid of it all? Rid of it all Let's
make a plan of attack Start looking forward and stop looking back Oh, yes Of
course, we still love her And we're always thinking of her Don't you know I
miss her, too? But tell me What's the use of feeling? What's the use of
feeling? What's the use of feeling? Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm Hmm hmm hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmmm [Door opens.]
And we have arrived.
That will be all, Pearl.
[Door closes.]
My Diamond.
My gracious, wondrous, luminous, lustrous Diamond.
Sss? [Gasps.]
Oh, my! It's truly an honor to bask in your radiance ses.
Get to the point, Agate.
[Clears throat.]
Yes, of course.
My deepest apologies.
You'll be pleased to know that your Sapphire has completed your special
delivery.
What special delivery? Um, the special delivery you requested from Earth, of
course.
I never asked any Sapphire to go to Earth.
I Um [Whispering.]
Oh, no! She's freezing up! Myfuture vision foresaw you, my Diamond, desiring
morehumans for the zoo.
So Iacted accordingly.
It's true.
The window for preserving Earth specimens is closing.
Phew! Is that what you want? Sapphire, has the cluster emerged yet? No, it has
not.
Then there's still time.
That will be all.
My Diamonds.
Two Diamonds?! I can't believe it! Can you believe it? Oh, well, of course you
can.
You probably foresaw the whole thing.
Sapphire: Of course! No surprises here.
I neve expected to see Yellow Diamond in person.
What a commanding presence.
You can just feel strength and confidence radiating from her.
Don't misunderstand me, of course.
I'll always be in Blue's confidence, but if I had been made for Yellow, you
wouldn't see me complaining.
I do hope they appreciate all my hard work to preserve the Pink Diamond legacy.
It would really make it worth being stationed here with these sorry excuses for
Gems.
Ohhh! It's a shame, though.
This outpost is so remote.
I was beginning to think we'd been forgotten.
But we haven't! Two Diamonds one day! What an honor.
I don't think anything could spoil this for me.
[Nervous laughter.]
Whatis the meaning of this?! Why are these two outside the containment area?!
Holly Blue, I can explain.
No need, your Clarity.
Not even you could have foreseen how incompetent these Amethysts are.
Well, if you want something done right, you just do it yourself.
You two are coming with me! [Gasps.]
[All gasp.]
Both: Garnet! Steven, get Greg on board! Greg: Yes, please! We'll handle this
noise.
[Grunts.]
[Grunts.]
Ooh! Together: Ooooooh! I've been waiting to do this all day.
Unh! [Groans.]
[Laughter.]
What are you doing?! They're traitors! Destroy them! - Bye! - Bye! [Smooches.]
Famethyst for life! I'll report you to the Diamonds! All of you! You'll all be
shattered! You're really gonna tell the Diamonds that you allowed a band of
traitorous rebels to infiltrate a highly secure facility and escape from right
under your careful watch? [Inhales sharply.]
Doesn't sound like a wise thing to do, Holly Blue.
[Whirring.]
So do yourself a favor and keep your mouth shut.
That will be all.
[Groans.]
[Guards cheering.]
[Laughter.]
Thanks so much for coming to get me.
That has to be like the third-craziest weekend I've ever had.
Dad, I'm really sorry I got you into all this.
This whole thing started 'cause I wanted answers.
You don't have to be sorry about a thing.
I hope you found what you were looking for.
I did.
I found you.
[Eerie music.]

**** The New Crystal Gems ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #

Oh! Good, old natural sand! That fancy zoo sand was too fine for me.
- Hey! Steven! - Connie! [Laughing.]
You're back, and you're okay! Did you get your ears pierced? Oh, man, you're
not gonna believe what happened! We went to a far-off space station, we made
some new friends, we warped the space-time continuum! I'm sorry we left you
behind.
It's okay.
You were really worried about your dad.
I'm just glad you're all back safe.
Yep all thanks to this guy.
Did anything happen while we were gone? Uh Lion behaved himself, I restocked
all the cereal and washed all the towels.
Sounds like everything went well.
Well, there was a little trouble When I got that call from you, I could tell
you had a lot going on.
Dad's in trouble and we need to go into space to get him back! I can get there
in 15.
Or actually maybe 20, 25 'cause I might have to take the bus There's no time!
We're going right now.
Just protect Beach City for me while we're gone! You can count on me! It was a
big job for one person, but I felt up to the challenge.
I made my way over to your house, and that's when I realized I wasn't alone.
[Gasps.]
Hyah! Uh, don't you knock? Weirdo.
Lapis? Peridot? What are you doing here? Just showing off my old room to Oh,
wait.
Actually, that's none of your business! Who is this, and what is she doing in
Steven's house? That's Steven's third-best friend after me and you.
Um, Lapis, you don't remember me? Mmm You almost drowned me when you tried to
steal the world's water.
I almost drowned a lot of people.
I'm Connie.
I'm Peridot! And this is our pumpkin.
[Barks.]
Oh! Hello! [Barks.]
So Steven told me you guys retired to the country.
What brings you here? Garnet trusted us with a mission! Oh, Steven gave me one,
too.
I just hope I don't let him down.
You probably will.
That's why they put us in charge of protecting Beach City.
But Steven asked me to do that! You really think we need your help? Wait a
minute! Maybe we do need your help.
The Crystal Gems have been protecting this world with a specialized team.
Three gems, each with their own role, and a human! Well, Steven's only half
human, but, hmm, close enough.
Meaning? To do the job of the Crystal Gems, we need to do the jobs of the
Crystal Gems! We four Four? I'm counting Pumpkin.
[Barks.]
We each need to pick someone from the original team and perform their role in
the group! We can be exactly like them but better! That sort of makes sense.
I call Garnet! I'm obviously best suited to being the boss.
You are very bossy.
Thank you.
Then I'll do what Steven does.
Lapis, you can be Amethyst.
Which one is she? I'm joking.
Great! You're already in character! What about your pumpkin? Whatever.
She can be Pearl.
[Barks.]
New Crystal Gems, congregate! That means come over here and do a cool pose.
[Gulls squawking.]
Hmm! Let's see Nothing there.
Judging from what Steven tells me, everything's normal! There! Am I doing it?
Am I as aloof and distant as the Garnet? You were, until you started to ask so
many questions! [Snickers.]
[Barking.]
[Horn honking.]
Man: Help! That sounds like it's coming from the car wash! Go! New Crystal
Gems! What seems to be the trouble here, Beach City citizen? It's my dad! Some
jerks have been messing with his head! [Fly buzzing.]
It was funny till he made me bring it here.
Can you guys wash it off? Oh, right! If Mr.
Universe and Steven are in outer space then we should run the car wash! Ahem.
Uh, "water" we waiting for? Ha ha! Good one, Steven.
Whatever you say, dudes.
Burp! [Barking.]
Well said, Pearl! [Grunting.]
What? Whoa! Here's your vehicle washed and buffed! Courtesy of the new Crystal
Gems! That was cool.
Thanks! After such a rocky start, it finally seemed like the new Crystal Gems
were coming together! Or were we? [Horns honking.]
Whoa! Looks like word got around.
Encore! Encore! I know what everyone is really here to see! Beach City
citizens, witness the Garnet! [Grunting.]
[Crowd oohing.]
[Crowd ahhing.]
Amethyst, your performance is lacking! Mess around! Crack some jokes! Oh, is
that what I'm supposed to be doing? [All gasp.]
Lapis! Uh, the Steven doesn't think that's funny! [Gurgles.]
Ha.
I can't believe this! The only one taking anything seriously around here is
Pumpkin! [Barking.]
That's right.
Pearl does like soap.
Uh, hey, you gonna bring our car down? Do not interrupt the Garnet! Everyone
will have a turn! [Murmurs.]
Oops! Peridot, put that guy down! No one bosses the Garnet! Well, Garnet
wouldn't yell at people! I agree.
Maybe you should let someone else play the Garnet.
Eh? [Crowd gasping.]
[Screaming.]
[Murmuring.]
No! Amethyst, I have the glasses! There is no Amethyst! Only Garnet! What are
you guys doing?! [Grunting.]
Hmm! [Groans.]
[Whimpers.]
Oh, no.
Gotta Steven this somehow.
Look at us! We're all fighting with each other! But we all love each other.
And you all love me.
So we all have to do this together for love! Steven would have had a better
speech.
I know.
She didn't even cry.
[Sighs.]
Connie: The wash was a wash.
And so were the new Crystal Gems.
I've done a lot of thinking about what's been going wrong with this team-up,
and I think it's obvious now that the problem is all of you! Connie, you
completely lack Steven's sentimentality.
He would have had a much more inspiring speech yesterday.
Lapis, your lack of humor has been hurting our morale.
Maybe you should switch with Pumpkin.
Let's make Pumpkin the Garnet.
You should be the Pearl.
I'm nothing like Pearl.
She's so uptight and sensitive! How dare you?! I'm leaving! That's so funny!
You should be Amethyst! That's so dumb! You should be a clod! Oh, so now I'm a
clod? I think you're the clod.
Wow! Your Peridot impression is lousy, too! Will you two can it?! That's not a
very Steven thing to say.
I don't care! So I'm not Steven! Maybe he's really great at helping people work
out these arguments! Maybe he's really patient and caring, even though it must
be hard for him having to be the adult for a bunch of super-powered children!
We're both thousands of years older than you.
Then act like it! Be the gems you've been for thousands of years, instead of
playing this silly game.
It's impossible trying to solve problems if we're just trying to copy other
people.
Oh, what's the point of this? We'll never be the Crystal Gems, we're just the
Crystal Temps.
But we have our own way of doing things.
So let's go back to that, to fix this mess we made.
- You do make a good Steven.
- Watch it.
Well if there's one thing Peridots are good at, it's fixing things! I guess I
could help wash away the rubble.
And I'll help us organize.
So here's how I think we should start You sure you wrecked anything? The car
wash looks good as new.
Well, except, we couldn't repair the sign.
Well, about time I got a new one.
Guess I'll give my neon guy a call.
Well, don't get out your checkbook yet.
Bring it on out! Introducing [Music.]
- a new sign! - For your business! We made it ourselves! Look at it, it's
great! - I think I love it! - Really? That old sign was okay, but this one's
got personality! Well, it wasn't much of a mission, but I guess we handled that
all right.
I knew you would.
Does that mean we can do a victory pose? Okay.
Together: Go, Crystal Temps!

**** Storm in the Room ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # Steven: Thanks again for
protecting Beach City while I was gone, Connie.
No problem.
And now that you're back from space, I officially relinquish control of your
bed to you.
Thank you for keeping it warm, sir.
[Both laugh.]
I hope your dad liked the new car wash sign.
He loved it.
I'm sure it'll look great when the Gems are done putting it up.
I hope they're back in time for me to say bye.
Uh It might be a while.
You wouldn't believe how many of them it takes to screw in a light bulb.
I wonder where my mom is.
She should have been here to pick me up by now.
[Ringing.]
You've reached Dr.
Maheswaran.
Please leave a message, and if you're one of my patients, you shouldn't have
this number! She's not answering.
Well, look on the bright side! Now we can hang out a little longer.
I'm sure she'll show up eventually.
I don't want to impose.
I mean, you must have a lot to think about after your space adventure.
You almost lost your dad, and all that stuff about the diamonds and your mom
I'd understand if you need some space.
Nah, the last thing I need right now is more space.
Okay.
So what do you want to do? The last word is a noun.
Um, multi-hulled watercraft.
Okay, here it goes.
"The wiggly baker baked some new wacky pastries.
There were snail puffs, lawnmower pies, and entropy muffins.
" [Ringing.]
"Everyone was so fuzzy that they ate everything even the cheesecake shaped like
a multi-hulled watercraft.
" [Laughs.]
This is really weird.
My mom always answers her phone.
Hmm.
Oh.
How about I give you a ride home on Lion? It's not getting home I'm worried
about.
What if she shows up here and we're gone? We should probably stay put until she
comes.
Well, while we're still waiting, how about another weird word game? Okay.
All right, let's see what we got here.
First one is an adjective.
Accidental.
Accidental.
And the next one's a noun.
Mishap.
Mishap.
Adverb? Unexpectedly.
Past tense verb? Crashed.
Noun? Explosion.
Wow, you're really worried about your mom, huh? Yeah.
It's just she's never late for anything.
[Inhales.]
[Exhales.]
[Gasps.]
Dr.
Maheswaran: Hello? I'm coming in.
Connie! Mom! [Door closes.]
Mom, what happened? I kept calling, but you weren't answering.
I was starting to freak out.
[Sighs.]
Well, surgery went long, and then I had to cover for Dr.
Stromberg, again.
My phone died, and I suspect one of my patients stole my charger and [Sighs.]
I'm so sorry, Connie.
It's okay, Mom.
Everything's fine now.
Thank you for letting Connie stay late.
Night, Steven! Night, Connie.
So he's back from the spa, huh? No.
I said space.
Huh.
[Sighs.]
[Beeps.]
[Grunts.]
Aw, that's nice.
[Thunder crashes.]
[Screams.]
[Sighs.]
[Sighs.]
You know, sometimes I wonder if it's even you up there smiling all day and
night.
I just want to know the real you.
Not the you that everyone tells me about.
I just want to know the truth.
[Whirring.]
Uh Hey, room.
It's been a bit, huh? Is that a new cloud? [Chuckles.]
Uh So I suppose you're wondering why I'm here.
I know nothing in here is real, but but I want to see my mom.
Hello, Steven.
Um, it's It's nice to meet you.
[Laughs.]
It's nice to meet you, too.
[Chuckles.]
Um, sorry.
This is a little weird for me.
That's okay.
So what do you want to do? Oh, uh I guess I hadn't thought that far ahead.
[Chuckles.]
Do you like video games? [Sound effects blare.]
So, tell me about this game, Steven.
Well, I guess it's an arm-wrestling simulator, which is spin-off of a fighting
game, based on a show about a lonely swordsman that I like.
It's kind of weird and hard to explain, but that's why I like it.
That sounds just marvelous.
[Grunts.]
K-O! Yeah, I won! Yay, you won.
What else do kids do with their parents? [Soft music plays.]
[Panting.]
[Grunts.]
Nice catch, son.
This is fun.
Or would baseball be better? Steven, all sports are beautiful.
Each sport is a unique experience.
The adrenaline, the glory, the sheer feats of athleticism.
Each one so complicated and yet exactly the same.
Whoa.
Hey, Steven! You know, I've always felt like something was unusual about my
adolescence.
Maybe this is what I've been missing football.
[Screams.]
[Both laugh.]
Touchdown! Steven I've been, uh, thinking about you a lot lately more than
usual.
Is that so? Yeah, well, for my whole life, I've been hearing stories about you.
About how amazing you were, that you were so kind and loving.
And every time I'd see the painting of you hanging in the temple, I'd be
inspired and reminded of how much I had to live up to.
I, uh I've even thought about dyeing my hair pink more than once.
[Chuckles.]
There's nothing wrong with your hair.
It's wonderful just the way it is.
Wonderful in every way, just like you.
Wow.
This is nice.
It's it's really nice.
[Voice breaking.]
I I should have tried this a long time ago.
But, Steven, don't you realize? We've been together this whole time.
Oh.
[Laughs.]
That's that that's right.
[Sniffles.]
Oh.
This is the first time we've hung out together.
I got to capture this moment.
There's nothing here but me.
I'm just talking to myself.
You're not my mom.
I'm not? This is how I want you to be, but I don't know if this is who you
really are.
I've learned things about you, things you wanted to keep secret.
You locked Bismuth away inside Lion because she wanted to shatter Gems, and you
never told Garnet or Pearl.
But then you shattered pink diamond.
Now all of Homeworld has it out for Earth and the Crystal Gems and me! You put
us all in danger, and you just disappeared! [Thunder crashes.]
Aah! Whoa.
Whoa.
Aaah! [Grunts.]
I finally know the truth.
I know what you are.
You're a liar! I thought you never wanted to hurt anyone, but you hurt
everyone! How could you just leave Garnet and Amethyst and Pearl and and Dad?
They don't know what to do without you! Maybe they didn't matter to you as much
as hiding from the mess you made! And that's why I'm here, isn't it? Did you
make me just so you wouldn't have to deal with all your mistakes? [Sighs.]
Is that all I'm here for? Steven, you know that isn't true.
In the tape I left you, I told you how much I wanted to have you and let you
exist.
Do you think what I said to you in the tape was a lie? No.
I'm sure I'm sure you meant it.
I get it.
I know you didn't want me to deal with your problems.
But you're a part of me now, and I have to deal with what you left behind.
Greg: Hey, Shtu-ball! Guess who's back in jean shorts.
And guess who also got you a pizza.
- It was me! - Dad! Amethyst! Garnet! And Pearl, too? They were all out of
pepperoni, by the way, so I just got you mushroom.
- I hope that's all right.
- It's perfect.

the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #

Space is great, but nothing beats some good ol' atmosphere.
Ronaldo: The horror! The terror! Protect yourself against the menace that
threatens Beach City! Protect yourself against the menace that threatens Beach
City? Mr.
Smiley, protect yourself against the menace that threatens Beach City? I'll
protect myself from the menace that threatens Beach City.
Steven! I knew I could count on you! Let's get knowledgeable! "How to Protect
Yourself Against Rock People"? What? "Alien entities walk among us"? "They're
adding mind-controlling minerals to our water suppl" "They hate men"?! Protect
yourself against the menace that Ronaldo! Wait! What is this? Well,
technically, it's an infozine pamphlet, but I've been calling them Ronalphlets.
I get that part.
I'm talking about all this mean stuff you're saying about the Crystal Gems! No,
no, no.
Crystal Gems aren't rock people.
Crystal Gems fight rock people.
See my documentary "Rising Tides, Crashing Skies.
" Crystal Gems don't just fight rock people.
We are rock people! Also, don't say "rock people.
" It's offensive.
Rock people are different, obviously.
For starters, they have rocks embedded in their bodies.
Like this? But they can summon weapons from the Mud Dimension.
[Warble.]
No, no, you're not getting it.
They can alter their forms.
That's how they trick humans into loving them! [Meows.]
Awwww! Wait a second.
You're a rock person?! I'm a Crystal Gem, Ronaldo.
[Yowls.]
And you're not wrong about everything.
We're just ignored and misunderstood.
I'm so glad you're the only one that took a Ronalphlet! I'm so sorry! [Crying.]
Hey, it's okay.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Just as long as you realize that the Crystal Gems and I aren't that different
from you.
Right.
Thanks, Steven.
I gotta go rethink some things.
"I'm shutting down my blog," blah blah blah, "social media," blah.
"I may never come back to the Internet!" [Chuckles.]
Whoa, dude.
I suppose it's a good thing that he's taking time to think.
There's a new post.
Hmm.
It's a video.
Good day, loyal followers of Keep Beach City Weird.
I've come to you today because I pride myself in bringing you the truth about
all the weird stuff in Beach City The Man doesn't want you to know about.
But today, I need to tell you some truths about this man! I've mixed up what is
right and wrong and ended up saying some pretty mean things about the Crystal
Gems.
I feel terrible about my mistake because I know more than anyone what it's like
to do thankless work and to be an outsider! That's why I'm joining the Crystal
Gems! [Snorts, laughs.]
What?! [Pounding on door.]
Steven! Ronaldo! Guess what! You want to join the Crystal Gems? [Gasps.]
I thought you'd never ask! You know, I always felt strangely at home here.
Unh-unh.
No.
You are not living here.
And you certainly can't join the Crystal Gems.
But You don't have a gem.
Your body is organic.
My body's organic, and I'm a Crystal Gem.
You're going to entertain this? We're all different, but we love and accept
each other.
That's what Crystal Gems do.
And isn't it great that someone is actually interested in what we do? What
better way to show him what we're about than to accept him as a Crystal Gem,
too? Uhhh Let's do this! Well, it's not the strangest houseguest we've had.
So, when do I get issued my gem? Ohhhh.
It doesn't really uh eh But if you had a gem, what would you want it to be?
Well, I care so much, I think it'd be, like, deep in my heart.
Or like a million tiny gems, like one crushed-up gem coursing through my blood,
like like Bloodstone! Perfect! That's your Crystal Gem name.
Wait! Check it out! I have a gem weapon now, too! Wow! A sword! I got it at
Delmarva Con last year.
It's a replica from the anime "I Can't Believe My Stepdad's My Sword.
" It can cut through a carton of milk like a carton of butter! There's a half-
full juice box by the TV.
Huhhhh Ahhhh! Nice! That star looks good on you.
[Warble.]
Thanks.
Mission time! Awesome! Let me grab my katana from upstairs.
[Grunting.]
[Wheezing, panting.]
I'm gonna take the stairs.
Uh, I'm sorry, Bloodfry.
You're going to have to sit this one out.
It's a bit dangerous.
But Steven gets to go.
Steven is different.
He's been training with us for years.
Steven: Don't worry, Bloodstone.
I didn't get to come along at first, either.
We can start your training soon.
Be back in a bit! [Warble.]
But I'm a Crystal Gem, too.
Umhi, Bloodstone.
Oh.
Hi, Steven.
Didn't see you there.
Sohow'd the mission go without me holding you back? Uh, it went fine.
You know, the usual fighting monsters, sharing emotions.
I'm glad you didn't get hurt with me not there.
Yeah.
Well, I'm heading out.
And you're going out like that? Uhlike what? Well, I just think a real Crystal
Gem would want to show off their gem, like, all the time.
If I had a gem, I'd show mine off.
Female voice [Calmly.]
: You are in a quiet forest.
The trees are quiet.
The sky is quiet.
A small rabbit begins to sing.
Ahhhh - Ronaldo: Rahh! - What the [Inhales deeply.]
[Grunts.]
[Sighs.]
Bloodstone, I know you want to train, but it's bedtime.
Funny that yousleep, when gems don't need sleep.
Why is that? I I don't know.
Because I'm half human, I get tired and I Huh.
Well, I'm two halves human, and I'm not [Yawns.]
tired at all.
[Clatter.]
Ever since I became a Crystal Gem, uhsleeping [Chuckles.]
I don't do it.
That's great, Bloodstone.
What a cool name.
I'm so cool.
Bye, Connie! See you tomorrow for sword training! Aah! Her gem weapon's a
sword, huh? She totally ripped that off from me.
What?! That sword belonged to my mom! How come I don't get your mom's gempon?
That's "gem" and "weapon.
" Well, Connie's been a part of the Crystal Gems longer than you, so Admit it
She's just in because she's your girlfriend.
What are you talking about?! She doesn't even live here! I'm here all the time!
Look at that quality groove I've established! If she was a real Crystal Gem,
she'd be a little bit more dedicated! Are you serious?! Bloodstone, ever since
you got here, all you've done is boss me around! Who are you to tell anyone how
to be a Crystal Gem?! You're just You're just a guy with a blog! Is that love?
Is that acceptance? Maybe you're the one that isn't a Crystal Gem.
I think you need to leave and think about stuff.
What is my problem? He just wanted to be included.
If I were really a Crystal Gem, I'd never Wait a second.
Ronaldo: [Laughs.]
Amethyst?! [Laughing.]
Yo, I didn't even say anything.
Bloodstone! We need to talk! You're right! The Crystal Gems are about love and
acceptance! But you've been acting really mean to me, and I don't love that.
I don't accept that.
I wish I hadn't snapped at you.
it's just I really thought you joined because you were interested in the
Crystal Gems.
But the second it wasn't about you, you stopped caring.
This isn't the Bloodstone club about making Bloodstone feel good.
This is my whole life! Do you care about that or not?! Whoa! You truthed him so
hard, he died! No! Bloodstone! Bloodstone! [Snoring.]
[Sighs.]
He's just asleep.
Guess staying awake for a whole week finally caught up with him.
Well, what do we do with Fryrocko now? We should let his parent know he's back.
[Warble.]
[Deep voice.]
Hey, Dad.
I'm back.
Blog, blog, blog.
That was really good! [Warble.]
[Normal voice.]
Thanks! I'lltext Peedee and let him know he's here.
You think he'll be okay? You've worried about him enough, Steven.
Crystal Gems, let's head back.
[Snoring.]
[Seagulls crying.]
Bloodstone! Oh.
Hey, Steven.
Are you all right? I haven't seen you in three weeks.
Yeah.
I took a real long nap.
And then I did some hard thinking.
I wasn't acting like Bloodstone.
I was acting like [Inhales deeply.]
Jerknaldo.
You accepted me, but I still felt like an outsider.
I guess even amongst outsiders, I am the ultimate outsider.
I think it's better Ronaldo Fryman work alone.
Are you sure? I was really glad you wanted to help our cause.
I still do.
Oh.
It's you and Pearl shaking hands.
When did that happen? I used the magic of photo-editing software.
Hey, but, uh Ronalphlets aside, can I ask you something? Yeah.
Why don't you use your Gem name? Oh.
My Gem name is my mom's name.
Actually, the only time Gems really call me that is if they're about to kidnap
me or beat me up.
That's rough, buddy.
You want me to put that in the Ronalphlet? - Ehh maybe not.
- Got it.

I love wrestling! [Bell dings.]
Ooh! Another devastating move by Purple Puma and Tiger Millionaire tonight,
folks.
Mr.
Smiley: Looks like Shark-O-Mania's seeing starfish after that last one.
Let's finish him off with our special move.
- Yeah, why not? - Take my hand.
Here it comes, y'all [Ding!.]
the Purple Millionaire Ki-i-i-i-i-i-i-ck! And Shark-O-Mania's out cold.
Somebody put that fish on ice before it stinks up the joint.
Folks, Tiger Millionaire and Purple Puma have done it again.
They are still your tag-team champions.
Will their special brand of jungle terror ever come to an end? [Cheers and
applause.]
Yeah! Don't ever stop! Tiger Millionaire and Purple Puma forever! Such
dedication to teamwork and friendship.
What?! [Sighs.]
Hey.
It's been fun, butI'm over this.
[Crowd gasps.]
W-What's going on? I'm through with this place.
Here's your belt back.
[Feedback.]
Hey, now.
That mic is expensive.
You can't just Oh, no.
You're just gonna do that and leave? Uh, sorry, everyone.
I guess this is over.
Bye, Mr.
Smiley.
What an unbelievable shame, folks.
[Booing.]
What?! That's it? You can't quit now.
Mr.
Smiley: What a sad and anticlimactic end to one of the greatest tag-team
careers to ever grace the squared circle.
[Sighs.]
Got my Saturday nights back.
Did you really mean what you said about being through with wrestling? Come on,
Steven.
Wasn't that match kind of boring? [Scoffs.]
We don't need wrestling to have fun anymore, right? Uh, right.
Yeah.
[Sighs.]
Let's go home and get some grub.
[Twinkle!.]
[Bell dings.]
Hey, Sadie.
Hey, Lars.
Can I get the special? Uh - Tiger.
- Aah! He left wrestling at the height of his career.
Why-y-y-y? Huh.
Why don't you just ask Steven? You and your theory.
Steven is not Tiger.
Tiger's ripped and like seven feet tall.
Well, I heard Purple Puma didn't want to do it anymore.
So what?! Just because Purple Puma quit doesn't mean Tiger had to.
I also heard Tiger didn't think of that.
Well, he should have.
It's the least he could do for his fans.
Hmm [Bell dings.]
Oh, it is him, right? Mr.
Smiley: Now, I know these days, we're in a depression, but underground
wrestling is too big to fail.
We've got two new fighters on loan, and they're here to collect.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Wolves of Wall Street.
We'll huff, we'll puff, and we'll blow your stocks down.
[Cheers and applause.]
What a rip-off.
[Door opens.]
What's this? It looks like we have a new challenger making his way into the
ring.
What mystery could possibly lie beneath that identity-concealing shawl? I don't
believe it.
Tiger Millionaire, ladies and gentlemen! [Coughs.]
[Cheers and applause.]
You're wrong, Mr.
Smiley.
Tiger Millionaire is gone forever.
He retired to his huge pile of money.
But he realized it didn't make him happy, so here I am, ready to give back to
the fans.
Tiger Philanthropist! [Cheers and applause.]
So, the millionaire becomes a philanthropist a person who gives money away.
But I ask you, can the Purple Puma's back-up make it solo? Bring it on! [Bell
dings.]
[Cheers and applause.]
Hey, tough boy.
You need a loan to start a small business? Oh, I'm actually pretty financially
stable.
'Cause you've just been approved.
But I just said Mr.
Smiley: Oh, my dang.
Billy Bank Assets just got a taste of the Philanthropist business-loan elbow.
Howl Jones is still in this match, though.
He's gonna make a withdrawal.
Oh! Overdraft.
This should cover your medical bills.
What a generous wrestler.
[Bell dings.]
Oh, what? Looks like Shark-O-Mania is back for revenge with a new partner the
Sea Wasp, which is a very poisonous type of jellyfish.
Ha.
Looks like we'll have to give 'em the ol' Purple Pu Man, how's Tiger gonna get
out of this fishy situation? [Growls.]
Oh.
He hit them with a charitable take-donation.
And now a venture catapult-ist.
Did you see that? [Bell dings.]
He's paying for their medical bills, too.
It looks like this philanthropist is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen.
No one is leaving here tonight unimpressed.
[Cheers and applause.]
[Bell dings.]
Hi, Lars.
UhWhat? So How was your evening? Fine, I guess.
Kind of boring.
What do you mean kind of boring?! Why are you so worked up over how my night
was? Oh, uh well, I was wondering if you'd seen any good wrestling matches
lately.
Ha! Now that you mention it, no.
But I heard Tiger Millionaire was back.
He's your favorite, right? Yeah, but he came back as some lame Tiger
Philharmonic donations thing, which, honestly, is such a weird angle, you know?
The whole thing just felt so off.
What do you mean off? He took off his tie, and he's throwing money at
everybody? It's like the sequel no one asked for.
What? It's the sequel you asked for.
Well, he just didn't seem into it, you know? He used to care about his money.
Now he's just giving it away.
And he still just wins, like, every match.
Oh, I get it.
You want him to lose and keep his money, right? No, I don't want him to lose,
just What do you want him to do?! Just tell me-e-e-e-e! I don't know! I don't
even know what I want for breakfast half the time.
I'm a complex individual teenage boy.
Now get out of here and stop taking such a personal interest in my happiness
and well-being! [Sighs.]
I don't get it.
I don't even know why I'm wrestling anymore.
I guess I'm doing it for Lars, and he doesn't even care.
I liked it better when I was doing it for you.
But who needs it, you know? I mean, I needed it when I felt likeI wasn't good
enough.
But I-I don't feel like that anymore.
[Chomps.]
[Muffled.]
Do you? No.
No, that that's never why I was doing it.
I just liked that it was our thing we did together.
But you're right.
It doesn't make sense anymore.
I think I should just do what you did just tell everybody I'm quitting and
leave like it's no big deal.
Ladies and gents, tonight is a very special night here at the Beach City
Wrestling Arena Dome and Building.
I'll let my good friend Tiger Mill I mean, Philanthropist explain.
Thank you, Mr.
Smiley.
What now? Tonight will mark my greatest and finalest act of philanthropy.
Tonight, I am giving away the tag-team titles.
Whoever can grab them first can have them.
[Booing.]
Boo! Philanthropy is lame! Boo all you like.
I don't care anymore.
These belts don't mean anything to me.
They never did.
[Booing.]
[Dinging, cranking.]
I know that sound.
It's the Brothers Construction Concrete Heat and Chunk Truck.
So sad to see Tiger giving up those belts without at least putting up a fight.
# Whoa! It's the Good-Looking Guys' music.
[Smooches.]
They're back to finally claim the tag titles.
Looks like things are heating up in the ring.
Who will be the next tag-team champion?! [Puma roars.]
Whoa, there, Tiger.
[Crowd gasps.]
Amethyst? He's back! The legend has returned to the ring! Pu-u-u-rple Pu-u-u-
ma! Those belts aren't yours to give away.
Those times we wrestled together meant everything to me.
You can give away all the jungle bucks you want, but I will not stand by and
let you give up our memories.
[Cheers and applause.]
Aww, what a display, ladies and gentlemen.
[Exhales sharply.]
You came back.
I'm sorry.
This was our thing we did together, and I just quit on you.
It's okay.
You were right.
We don't need this anymore.
Well, then how do you want to go out? With a bang.
It looks like this fight for the belt is still on.
The Brothers Construction look like they're ready to lay down a foundation of
pain.
[Bell dings.]
But, oh.
Shark-O-Mania is back again.
He's not even in the match.
[Ding!.]
Tiger Philanthropist is down.
What?! [Ding!.]
[Ding!.]
[Ding!.]
[Ding!.]
This isn't fair.
Stop the match.
They're gonna be destroyed.
Both: Finish it.
[Ding!.]
Mr.
Smiley: No! The Good-Looking Gang hit the star-crossed lovers on Puma and
Tiger.
This is their chance.
The belts are hanging free and clear.
They've got it.
It's official.
The Good-Looking Gang are the new Beach City Underground Tag-Team Wrestling
Champions.
This is truly the end for Tiger Millionaire and Purple Puma.
What a way to go out.
How can this be happening?! It was just getting good! You can't quit now!
Tiger! [Sobbing.]

Ruby
****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e19 Episode Script ******
**** Room For Ruby ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # Ooh there's one! Garnet,
you gotta make a wish! All right.
Close your eyes.
All of them.
Okay, okay.
Now make your wish, but don't tell me what it is.
Garnet, what did you wish for? I wished for another shooting star, so that you
could make a wish.
Oh, my gosh! [Gasps.]
Garnet, it worked! [Whistling.]
Is that star screaming? [Screaming.]
What was that?! [Gasps.]
It's Navy! That's a ruby.
Don't you remember? I gave them all names.
This one's Navy, 'cause her gem is on her navel.
Oh.
I finally get it.
[Grunts.]
[Gasps.]
Oh, please, oh, please! Don't make me go back to Homeworld! Oh, I just want to
stay here with you! This is a surprise.
You want to live on Earth? Yeah! All the other rubies are mean to me.
I just want to be somewhere I can be myself.
And you're not mad at us from before? What do you mean? You know, about
tricking you into playing baseball.
That was fun! Or when Amethyst pretended to be Jasper.
I gotta admit, that was pretty clever.
Or when we blasted you all out into space and stole your ship so you'd be
stranded forever? Well, we were fighting, so it's understandable.
I don't know about this.
She tried to stab you in space.
That was Eyeball, this is Navy.
She always seemed really nice, actually! Hey, thanks! And, you know, a ruby
falling from the sky, discovering this beautiful world sounds a lot like a
story you told me once.
Oh, stop.
Ah! Let me take it from here! I know exactly where she'll fit in! All right,
Steven Universe, go work your magic.
Finally! There's a star to wish on! Peridot, Lapis! - Steven! - Steven!
[Barking.]
And Pumpkin! Can't forget you! Well, well, back again.
You should just move in with us at this point.
Actually, maybe not me, but I know someone else who might be interested! Hi!
I'm Navy, a refugee from Homeworld! Just like you guys! Ha ha ha! - Ooh.
- So, uh When did you show up on Earth? Today! New barnie! What?! No, hold on.
Can we talk about this first? Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course! [Chuckles.]
I love talking! Huh? Steven, this makes no sense.
Why would she want to live here? We've been awful to her.
She must hate us.
She doesn't, though.
Give her a chance.
She's on our side now.
Just like that? Wow.
There's no way.
Well, you guys wanted to start a new life here, too.
It can totally happen! Even if she wants to be here, she doesn't know what
she's getting into.
Life on Earth is really confusing.
It took me a long time to get used to it.
I'm still getting used to it.
- Hmm.
- But we can show her the way! I mean, we've been through the ringer on all
this stuff.
It'll be cool to share what we've learned.
And, you know, I think we'd be really good at it.
Okay.
Okay, I'll give it a try, but we'll have to take it slow.
Yeah! This will be great, I just know it! [Pumpkin barking.]
Woop! Thank you! So you're an Earthling! But what does that mean? Well, the
answer is who knows?! [Laughing.]
And that's the beauty of Earth! Nothing here makes sense! But that's why you
have us now! It might be hard to like Earth at first.
It is where a bunch of bad stuff happened.
I love it! It's so sunny! Ah, yes! The sun ever-burning until it's not.
This planet has weather, which can be confusing and alarming.
It's sunny now, but it could always rain later.
What is rain? It's like oh, wait! I can just show you.
Whoa! [Gasps.]
I know it's a bit strange, but Whee! Oh! [Laughing.]
The sky is crying! She likes it! Navy likes it! [Laughing.]
Oh! A planet that's not always sunny.
It's almost like it's alwayschanging! [Laughing.]
That's so beautiful! Yeah! Exactly! Wow! That's, like, chapter 97 of Earth
stuff.
Looks like we got an advanced student on our hands! Yeah.
No kidding.
[Snoring.]
This is our "gem cave.
" Lapis hates when I call it that, so I don't.
The barn's pretty big, so you can have one of the corners.
[Chuckles.]
Make it your own.
That sounds so nice.
Any corner would be lovely.
You should have a look around.
Ohh! What's this for? That's a hammock.
It's a bed you fall out of.
It's where I like to sleep.
I don't have to do it, but I like to do it you know, turn off for a bit and
Snore.
Like this! [Loud snoring.]
Snore! Wow! Sounds groovy! How do I start? That one's really hard to explain.
You lay down somewhere and close your eyes.
And think about nothing or everything.
But it may take you a little while to feel comfortable enough to [Snoring.]
Looks like you've got it.
And here's our organic Earth farm.
The ground beneath our feet is teeming with resources which feed the growing
crops around us.
Don't bother talking to the corn.
It can't hear you.
Plants may seem strange to you at first, but don't worry, you don't have to
love everything right away.
I love plants! Oh! Well, what about Pumpkin? Do you love Pumpkin, too?
[Whimpers.]
I love Pumpkin! Hoo! Ew, Pumpkin kisses! [Laughing.]
Well, what about dirt? Do you love the dirt, too? What's dirt?! [Gasps.]
I do love the dirt! [Laughing.]
So what about us? How do you feel about us? [Laughing.]
You guys are the best! Thank you, thank you! Thank you all for taking me in!
Oh! We're gonna be the best of friends! But we were just enemies! Don't you
remember? Why don't you get mad?! I think even if I really tried, that's the
one thing I can't do.
Oh, come on! Did I do something? I think it might be more complicated than
that.
Why don't you stay here and admire more of the plants? - Lapis! - Lapis!
[Barks.]
[Sighs.]
- Lapis! - Lapis! - Where are you?! - She's just It's just like she's fine with
us, like there's no problem.
Lapis, are you okay? No.
Something is seriously wrong with me.
It took me so long to learn to like this planet.
Hey, no one said there's a rush! Navy just loves everyone and everything right
away.
She has no guard, no fear.
I just don't get it.
Why is it so easy for her, when it was so hard for me? Navy: Oh, no! [Pants.]
I didn't mean to make anyone upset! Oh! Maybe I should just go! - Aw, Navy.
- No, no, it's my problem.
I didn't mean to make you feel like you don't belong here.
Yeah, you should stay! Ooh, you guys! I'm so glad! I don't know where I would
go anyway.
I can't go anywhere without my ship.
That's the only place I've ever really belonged, anyways.
I miss it so much! Oh! [Sobbing.]
Navy! We have your ship! It's right over there! You do? Wow! I didn't even
notice it there! Maybe you could, uh show us the ropes? [Gasps.]
I would love that! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! This is perfect! The Crystal Gems
finally have a pilot! Things are going okay now, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, they are! Hey, Steven, hit that button behind you, and I'll show you what
this baby can really do! Uh, you mean the one right here? Yeah! That's the one!
I'm gonna press it! [Whirring.]
[Screaming.]
Navy! Hello?! Navy, I think something went wrong with the ship! The only thing
wrong is that you're still holding on.
[Laughing.]
Wait! This whole time, all you wanted was your ship? You could have just stolen
it to begin with! I could have done that.
But then I would never have gotten to see the look on your face when you were
tricked by your favorite little ruby! [Laughs.]
- What?! - Hey! I can't hear what's happening! Is Navy showing us the ocean?
Oh! 'Cause this is a heck of a way to do it! You dirty, little [Gasps.]
Bye-bye! [Screaming.]
Quick, Lapis, she's getting away! [Laughing.]
I was right! No one could be that well-adjusted! [Laughs.]
Garnet! It was still worth a shot.
[Navy laughing.]

- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save

# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #

I'm going to become half of you.
And I need you to know that every moment you love being yourself, that's me,
loving you, and loving being you because you're going to be something
extraordinary.
You're going to be [Rewinding.]
You're going to be something extraordinary.
You're going to be something extraordinary.
[Rewinding.]
Extraordinary experience.
[Growls.]
Okay, I think I've got something.
[Clears throat.]
So, this time, I put together the first letter of the first word of every
sentence.
It spells "Ittaisiaby.
" [Purring.]
It might not sound like much, but if you rearrange those letters, it says "Bait
it I say," or "I stay a bit," or "I bitty Asia.
" Well [sighs.]
"I bitty Asia" could mean something.
Maybe I'm supposed to go back to Asia? And bite something? [Yawns.]
[Sighs.]
There has to be a clue somewhere.
Mom said she wanted to have me.
But that must mean there's a reason.
There has to be something I was meant to do.
My magical gem destiny.
[Snorting, gagging.]
Come on, Lion.
I need you to focus here.
[Lion retching.]
No, no, no! Lion, at least do it on the floor! [Liquid splatters.]
Why is it always on the bed? [Gasps.]
Magical hair-ball destiny! [Lion retches.]
Okay.
That's gross.
Right.
Anyway.
This key.
Mom must have wanted you to give this to me now.
What does it open? Hm Oh! Hey, Lion.
Mm? Mm.
Mmmm! [Gasps.]
Maybe if I [Gasps.]
If this key isn't for that chest, then what is it for? [Music.]
[Splashing.]
Nothing to unlock here.
So, not here, either? Give me something this key unlocks.
[Pop!.]
[Gasps.]
[Pouf!.]
[Groans.]
Hmm [Gasps.]
Of course! The answers were inside me the whole time! [Sighs.]
Where am I supposed to go? This has to unlock something.
There must be someplace I haven't been.
Lion.
Take me somewhere new.
[Yawns.]
Hey, come on.
Where did you get this? Can you please take me there? Pleeeeease? [Muffled.]
Pleeeee [Normal voice.]
eeeease? [Wind whistling.]
Hey.
This is where we found you.
Something of Mom's is hidden here, right? Take me there.
[Music.]
[Weakly.]
Where are we going? It's been hours.
[Sighs.]
Mom who were you? Who am I? Garnet Amethyst Pearl They won't say it, but I know
they expect something big from me.
But how can I fulfill my destiny if I don't even know what it is? Who am I
supposed to be? Mom? [Gasps.]
So this is it.
Couldn't we have just warped here? Whatever's behind this door, I know it's
something important.
Please tell me my destiny.
[Click.]
Wha ? What? Is this just Rose's trash dump? No.
Please! There was supposed to be something here to tell me my purpose! This is
just a bunch of garbage Mom left behind! [Growls.]
[Sniffles.]
Huh? It's another tape from Mom? But wh-who's Nora? A-Am I not the only one? Do
I have a sister? Lion! What is this? W-Who's Nora? I know I've asked a lot from
you today, but please, just one more time.
I need your help.
I need to know what this tape means.
I won't get mad the next time you throw up on my bed.
This is near Beach City.
Lion, are you sure this is the right [Guitar music playing.]
Nora.
[Panting.]
Oh, hey, Shtu-ball.
Dad?! You're Nora? Who? What are you doing here? Getting some songs figured
out.
Ah, this is sort of my jamming hill.
Used to be a tree by the warehouse, but a 7th-grader with a flute muscled me
out.
Uh yeah.
[Sighs.]
Are you okay? I found this.
Oh, my gosh.
I never thought I'd see this again.
You've seen this tape before? Of course.
Come here.
You should, too.
He's following me now! [Rose laughing.]
Rose Quartz: Maybe he'll help you with your intro this time.
- Dad? - Shh! Keep watching.
Okay now! They call me Mr.
Universe! Get ready, baby, 'cause you're gonna have the coolest dad this side
of the cosmos.
[Strumming, vocalizing.]
This is - Rose Quartz: I press it now, right? - Do it.
- Whoa! - Greg? [Laughs.]
Can we edit this part? [Laughing.]
No, no.
It's perfect.
Isn't it wonderful, Nora? This world is full of so many possibilities.
my video.
Each living thing has an entirely unique experience.
The sights they see, the lives they live are so complicated and so simple.
This is just like the video Mom made me.
Nora, we can't both exist.
But I won't be gone.
I'm going to become half of you.
And every moment you enjoy being yourself, that will be me, loving being you.
No! I don't understand.
Why is this the same as the video you guys made me? Who's Nora? [Chuckles.]
N-Nora is you.
I'm my mom and my sister?! What kind of destiny is this?! [Laughs.]
No, no.
We just had it down to two names Steven if you were a boy, and Nora if you were
a girl.
So, then, would Nora have the magical destiny if I wasn't here? Magical
destiny? I don't know about that.
But Mom did! She was trying to tell me something with my tape.
She keeps leaving me puzzle pieces.
Sooner or later, I'm going to understand what I'm for! Whoa! Steven, it's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
Am I supposed to be D-did she want me to be Nora? Steven, she just wanted you
to be you.
When you have a kid, you have no idea who they're gonna be.
Even Garnet couldn't predict it.
That's what was so exciting to your mom, that life is full of so many
possibilities, and you would get to explore them for yourself.
I mean, you could be Steven or Nora or anyone else.
And you can always change your name.
Hey, I did.
Because you're going to become something extraordinary.
You're going to be a human being.
[Giggles.]
That's my favorite part.
A human being.
A human is an action.
I wonder who, how you'll be, what you'll think, what you'll want.
Oh, I'm so happy for everyone who's going to know you.
[Chuckles.]
I'm rambling.
If they look to you, trust yourself.
Take care of them, Nora.
[Static.]
So that's it.
I'm just supposed to be her kid.
Well yeah.
- Is that okay? - Yeah.
I think I can handle that.

the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #

Peedee.
Oh, and tell Ronaldo I hope his weird rash clears up soon.
[Grunts.]
Life can get really intense, huh? Yeah, especially your life.
Let's see alien abduction.
Going to a weird zoo for humans in space.
And sneaking out right past a pair of intergalactic tyrants! [Both laugh.]
Well, it's nice to know we can still have peaceful days like this without any
trouble.
- Mm.
Oof.
- Almost.
[Laughs.]
Man: Hey, kid! Drop those fry bits.
Drop 'em! - Oh, no, it's the cops! - Huh? All the years of ordering off menu
have finally come back to taunt me! You mean haunt you? Steven, that's not even
a police car.
- It's just - I surrender! I knew I was breaking the rules, but I did it
anyway! The bits had their hooks in me! [Laughs.]
Dad, quit joking around.
Come on, Connie! I almost had him.
Mr.
Maheswaran? [Sighs.]
Wow, I didn't think he'd take it that seriously.
You okay there, Steven? Oh, yeah.
I love it down here.
And how's my swashbuckling swashbuckler doing? I'm good.
You know, Steven, maybe you're dehydrated.
Probably from eating that garbage before dinner.
Respectfully, fry bits are not garbage.
Don't worry, Steven.
He's just messing with you.
[Chuckles.]
Sorry, Steven.
Let's get you up.
What are you even doing in Beach City, Dad? I'm out here on a job, actually.
The private security company I work for got a call from a Mr.
Harold Smiley stating that someone's been lurking around Funland after hours.
So, I'll be here all night on a stakeout.
- Whoa, a stakeout! - Dad, that's so cool! Yeah, it is pretty cool, huh?
Protecting the citizens of Beach City.
- Just like you guys! - Wouldn't that be fun, Steven? I'd love to go on a
stakeout sometime.
Maybe you guys could help out tonight.
- What?! - What?! Even though we're not officially sanctioned security
personnel? Hey, why not? It's probably just some kid loitering.
Hey, kid! Yes, hello? The sign above you says no loitering.
They get younger every year.
So, y'all ready for this? Some of these teens can use some pretty strong
language.
Hey, Steven, you want to help ruin some teen's night? Always.
[Whispering.]
Coast is all clear behind us.
Things seem pretty quiet so far.
Well, yeah.
Nobody's even gonna try hopping the fence with us here.
But you never know.
Sometimes, I actually leave the car.
- Wow.
- Wow.
I'm sure you guys do lots of waiting when you're saving the world.
It can't be all bam-pow action all the time.
Aw, I wish.
There's a lot of fighting.
I mean, I kind of inherited an intergalactic war.
Hey, Dad, what's this box? Oh, I just confiscated that from a kid who was
shoplifting in a costume shop.
Whoa! You could totally use these for disguises.
Don't you ever need to go undercover? How do you know I'm not undercover right
now? Just kidding.
[Chuckles.]
I need these to see.
But if you guys want to play with that stuff, go ahead.
Okay.
Well, I want to be undercover.
I'll be [Music.]
Veronica Cucamonga.
[Italian accent.]
It's a-me, Peter Pizzapoppolis from Italia! Pizzapoppolis? That sounds Greek.
You sure you don't want anything, Dad? There's a clown nose back here.
[Nose squeaks.]
No, thanks.
Being a security guard is no joke, which is why they equip us with these.
Wow! A flashlight! Yeah.
It gets pretty dark out there.
[Crash.]
What was that?! [Music.]
Mama mia! The fence-a! How on earth did this happen? If this were some punk
with a pair of bolt cutters, this would be a clean cut.
But this chain looks like it was torn apart.
This was no kid.
Well, if it wasn't a misguided teen, what could it be? It's up to us to find
out.
Sounds like we better investigate.
Cucamonga, Pizzapoppolis.
Both: Right! Huh? [Music.]
Hello? This is security! You are trespassing on private property.
Do not attempt to make yourself a corn dog.
Funland Incorporated is not liable for the harm you may incur while trying to
operate a deep fryer without a license.
You need a license to operate a deep fryer? [Crashing.]
Whoa.
Hey, stop right there! [Panting.]
Follow my lead.
[Grunts.]
- Don't move! - Connie: Did we lose them? Which a-way did they go so fast-a?
Mouths closed, eyes and ears open.
- Hm.
- Hm.
[Wind whistling.]
[Creaking.]
Bad move, chump.
That space ship's permanently earthbound.
Gotcha! I mean freeze! Oh, man.
Are we dealing with some sort of escape artist? Hey, Steven, maybe we should
get our weapons.
That won't be necessary.
We're not here to escalate the situation.
Besides, a good security guard only needs their trusty flashlight.
[Clank.]
Hey! Open up this instant! Yeah, let us out! [Grunts.]
[Electricity hums.]
The ride's moving! [Music.]
- We got to shut it off! - Don't worry.
I'll just use my trusty flashlight.
[Grunts.]
Oh, no! The laws of physics! Ow! - You okay, Dad? - Yeah.
I've got a new idea, though.
This time, I'll throw it at an angle.
- Dad, I don't think that'll work.
- Go! [Grunts.]
Aah! [All screaming.]
We got to get out of this spicy meatball! [Grunts.]
Hey, this part isn't moving at all.
Steven! [Grunts.]
Sorry! [Electricity hums.]
[All groaning.]
Listen, you bodybuilding escape artist criminal, this isn't a game.
You've endangered an officer of the law and two small children.
Show yourself before you get into serious trouble! Steven, do you think maybe
it's some kind of Gem mutant or monster? It could be, but it trapped us.
The monsters and mutants aren't that smart.
Could we be dealing with a Homeworld Gem? Homeworld? Gem? Mutant? I, uh well,
whatever it is, if someone's trespassing, they'll have to answer to me.
[Music.]
It's so quiet.
[Electricity hums, carnival music plays.]
[All gasp.]
I can't believe this.
They're mocking us.
Show yourself! What is it that you want here? Prizes? Fun? You think this is
the place to get your kicks? You sick monster.
Destroying the sanctity of this land of fun! Behind you! [Grunts.]
Dad! [Normal voice.]
Mr.
Maheswaran! Uh, don't worry.
I'm fine.
- Just there they are! - Come on, Steven! I'm right behind you! You're not
getting away this time! [Music.]
- That's a lot of gumballs! - Jump! [Grunts.]
Aah! [Grunts.]
- It's time to give up! - There's no way out! Doug: Gumballs? Aa-aa-ah!
[Grunts.]
[Groans.]
Hey, kids.
The culprit's at the end of this corner, Dad.
Good work, you two.
Now, let's shed some light on this subject.
Wait.
Onion! You? What are you doing here? We're in the middle of a very important
investigation.
Dad, I think this is who's been causing all this trouble.
Onion, it's me, Steven.
Steven Universe.
[Murmuring frantically.]
That's just Mr.
Maheswaran.
Oh, my gosh, did you think a bunch of strangers were chasing you? No wonder you
were trying to throw us off your trail.
Onion, everything's okay.
It can't just be a kid.
It doesn't make any sense! What about that huge shadow? I think the flashlight
just made him look big.
But the fence was ripped apart! I have seen him use a blowtorch before.
I also found this piece of fabric stuck in the fence.
[Groans.]
Of course.
- It's never actually something.
- What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.
It's just my job isn't like the exhilerating adventures you've been having with
Steven or the life-threatening emergencies your mom deals with at the hospital.
The most action I see is telling kids to quit loitering around.
I was hoping maybe you'd get to see me take on a serious job, but I guess all
I'm good at is being your silly, old dad.
[Gasps, grunts.]
You're right.
You are silly, but that's why I like hanging out with you.
I've got enough serious things going on in my life.
Sometimes I just want to spend time with my dad.
Thanks.
[Chuckles.]
You're a keeper, Veronica Cucamonga.
[Laughs.]
Well, kid, this may have been a big misunderstanding, but you're still in
trouble for this fence.
Oh, yes, you are.
Just let him off the hook on this one.
We already scared him straight.
The law must be different for someone his age.
[Sighs.]
You learned your lesson? Then you're free to go.
[Car door opens, closes, engine starts.]
And remember, kid, no loitering.
I don't know how I'm gonna explain this back at the office.

Lars
****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e22 Episode Script ******
**** The Good Lars ****
1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in
Garnet # - # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # So, how is it?
Be honest, but not too honest.
It's pumpkin bread! And it's pumpkin-shaped, like a pumpkin! This is the best
idea anybody has ever had! See? I told you.
It's really good.
Of course Steven likes it.
He likes everything.
- Lars, did you make this? - No! Well, yes, but it's no big deal.
Secret's out, Lars.
Feels good, doesn't it? - Ah, stop.
- Oh, this is amazing! How'd you get it to look like a pumpkin? I just made
seven small crescent-shaped cakes and used cream-cheese icing to hold them
together.
Anyone with two hands and half a brain could do it.
And, you know, a recipe.
- That's his way of saying thanks.
- I know.
I speak Lars.
B-B-B-Buck Dewey! - Hi, Buck.
- Hey, Steven.
- Hey, doughnut kids.
- Hi, Buck, what's up?! How's it going? What'll it be? I want to order you to
come to dinner.
Me, Jenny, and Sour Cream are having a potluck.
You know, like parents do.
Except we'll be doing it.
All three of you should come.
You should bring some food, because that's what you do at a potluck.
It's so funny.
[Laughs.]
That is funny, Buck! It sounds great.
Super cool.
Can't wait.
Bingo, bongo.
Cool.
[Doorbell chimes.]
[Groans.]
"Bingo, bongo"? - Where did I even learn that? - Steven: Yeah! Bingo, bongo!
This is gonna be great.
Hey, yeah, this is perfect.
You won't believe us when we say we like your cooking, but you'll have to
believe it when it's coming from Buck.
[Groans.]
- Uh, Lars? - I'm not going.
What?! You just got invited to a party with the cool kids! Isn't that what
you've always wanted? If anyone shouldn't go, it's me, but they know you.
They like you! Unh-unh.
Nobody knows me.
- And nobody knows I can bake.
- Well, I do, and he does.
Yeah, Lars, you should make this your big debut.
Well then, it has to be perfect.
[Dog barking.]
- How about a pie? - No.
Uh, baked Alaska? It might look like I'm trying too hard.
Hmm.
Yeah, something cream-filled.
A bundt? A cannoli? Maybe some rugelach? [Groans.]
I don't know! Sadie: Maybe we could make a cake - with your face on it.
- Steven: That's a great idea! You should make something that represents you.
[Gasps.]
- Secret cookbook.
- Maybe this'll work.
I used to eat this as a kid all the time.
Wow.
What's uby? - It's ube.
- What's that? Uh, like, you know, it's like a sweet potato.
Potatoes can be sweet? I mean, it's technically a yam.
- Yams?! - This sounds perfect! [Music.]
Ube Ube It's done.
So, how is it? - It's amazing! - Amazing! - This is delicious.
- You're an amazing baker, Lars.
Well, yeah, of course I am.
[Mouth full.]
Sorry, Lars.
It's really good.
Guess I have to take your word for it.
Sadie: I'm gonna head out and get my stuff for the party.
This is it! It's all happening! Lars and the cool kids! See ya there! Bye,
Sadie.
[Sighs.]
- Everything is so good.
- Lars: Yeah, too good.
- What do you mean? - Uh, never mind.
Aw, come on.
You can tell me anything.
I spent a day in your body.
It's nothing.
Forget about it.
[Whispers.]
Open up about your feelings.
[Sighs.]
I'm not worried about the cake.
The cake is gonna rule.
I'm worried about showing up with a cake.
- What do you mean? - There's a reason I don't like telling anybody I like
baking.
- And what's that? - Because it's lame, Steven! If I show up to this party with
my family's weird purple cake and with Sadie, everybody's gonna know I love
baking and everybody's gonna know I love This isn't gonna be an ironic potluck.
It's gonna be, like, family, couple, neighbor, actual potluck, and I'm gonna be
there being all bingo, bongo.
These are your friends.
They want you to come.
That's why they invited you so they'll get to know you better.
If they like you, they like you.
If they don't, then it's their loss.
Right? That's pretty smart.
When did you get so mature? Somewhere in between learning to summon my shield
and finding out my mom is a war criminal.
Okay! I'll do it.
Lars! It's going to go so good! I got to get going and make my thing, - but
I'll see you there, right? - Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you.
[Crickets chirping.]
- Hey, man.
- Who's feeling lucky? - My, my.
What a feast.
- I brought the soda.
- I brought the pizza.
- I brought the assorted fruit.
I can't wait for Lars to get here.
He made a wait, wait, I shouldn't tell you.
- It's a surprise.
- That Lars is full of surprises.
The other day, he did this thing.
What was it? "Bingo, bongo.
" It was transcendent.
- That is so creative.
- Bingo, bongo.
[Doorbell rings.]
That's him! Oh, Sadie.
Where's Lars? He's not here yet? He's probably still working on the cake.
This is his "ube" debut, after all.
[Chuckles.]
Why don't you come on in? - Oh, uh - I love me some cheese.
[Laughs.]
You and your fancy cheese plates.
[Laughs.]
- Oh, hey, it's doughnut girl.
- Everybody, this is Sadie.
- Uh, hi.
I'm Lars' friend.
- What's up? I'm Jenny.
- Hey again.
- I'm Sour Cream.
Welcome to my house! So, tell us, Sadie, what did you bring to our very cool
potluck? Sorry, I didn't bring any food.
Just these paper plates.
It's just, uh, they're for Lars' thing, and he's not even here.
Actually, I probably should just show myself Did you say plates? Hooray! Now I
don't have to do the dishes.
Wow, I never thought anyone could get excited over paper plates.
I guess they are biodegradable.
But I'm still worried about Lars.
I'll go find him.
Don't you worry about it.
- Hang out, have fun.
- You can sit on the bean bag.
Yeah, that bean bag is sick.
You got to try it.
Oh, all right.
[Grunts.]
What do you know? I fit.
[Laughter.]
Told ya.
I'll be right back with Lars.
Now, where could he be? [Music.]
La-a-a-a-a-a-rs! Lars! If only there was some way to contact him with my mind.
Oh, wait, or with my phone! [Cellphone beeping.]
This is Lars.
Leave a message.
[Beep.]
La-a-a-a-a-rs! I mean, Lars, hi.
This is Steven.
Uh, I was just wondering where you were.
The potluck is going really great.
Everyone's having a nice time, and we're all excited for you to come join the
fun.
Or maybe I just missed you and you're already back at the party [Music.]
and that's the sound of you enjoying music with all our friends.
Or maybe you decided not to go inside.
Th-That's okay, though.
Guess I'll see you later.
[Sighs.]
Pizza potluck [Music.]
Potluck, potluck Potluck Potluck Potluck [Vocalizing.]
Potluck Potluck.
- Sour Cream: All right! - Nice! - Hey, nice ending.
- Yeah, whoo! Yeah, Sadie.
That was fresh.
Oh, hey, it's Steven.
Hey, Steven, we've been having such a blast over here.
- Did you find Lars? - Uh, yeah.
He He can't make it tonight.
- Something came up.
- Ah, bummer, huh? [Sighs.]
Well, that's okay.
Let's keep playing music.
- Right on.
- Yeah! - Bye, guys.
See ya.
- Bye, guys.
Later, guys.
- So, he decided not to come, huh? - Actually Aw, geez.
Lars.
Maybe we should've tried harder to get him to come.
Guess so.
Ugh.
He wants to be in with them so much.
[Chuckles.]
It's funny.
I never thought I'd be the one hanging out with them.
You know, they really are cool.
Like, not like he thinks, but, like like, they're actually cool people.
How's he going to realize that if he doesn't give them a chance? I wish I could
just force him to be happy.
Oh, no.
I sound like my mother.
Maybe I should be trying to fix my life instead of his.
Bingo, bongo.
- Goodnight, Steven.
- Goodnight, Sadie.

Dad?
****** Steven Universe (2013) s04e23 Episode Script ******
**** Are You My Dad? ****
1 Hey, Mr.
Postman, bring me a post Bring me the post that I love the most Dagnabit! - Yo!
No package yet? - No package yet.
I definitely ordered a pair of khakis from The Distinguished Boy.
They should've been delivered by now.
I'm a distinguished boy, Amethyst.
Don't I deserve distinguished khakis? Aww.
Want one of these instead? No, thanks.
Any second now.
Hey, Mr.
Postman, bring me a post! Consarn it! Still no Jamie.
I don't understand.
He's usually so punctual.
[Sighs.]
[Hums.]
Bring me a post Hey, you shouldn't have to waste your whole day waiting for
some thing in the mail.
Take this can of magic beans into town and trade it for a donut! You've been
drinking beans? They're good for the heart.
Unfortunately, I know from experience The Big Donut does not accept magic beans
as currency.
But you'd still wait for Jamie while I got us some donuts? Sure.
Why not? We'll hold down the fort while you're gone.
Pearl: Amethyst! Steven! Look! We're building a tiny house for crabs! Welcome
to your new home.
Oh! They like it! [Laughter.]
Thanks, Amethyst! No prob! Just bring me back a bear claw! [Gulps.]
[Humming.]
Good morning, Sour Cream! Putting on a big rave tonight? Oh the fliers.
No, it's Onion.
He's been missing for a couple of days now.
My mom and Yellowdad are starting to get worried.
You haven't seen him around lately, have you? No.
Have you checked his favorite hiding spot in the woods? Sure did.
What about inside the vending machine at Funland? No luck.
Blew a dollar checking, too.
What about that top-secret room inside your house? You mean his office? Of
course.
Hmm.
Eh, I'm sure he's fine.
If he's anything like me when I was a kid, he's probably just I don't know
raving in a friend's backyard.
Anyway, I'd better hang the rest of these up.
Can you make sure Lars and Sadie get one of these? I wanted to hang one up at
The Big Donut, but it's closed.
Closed? Lars! Sadieeeeeee! They have to be here.
I know what you guys are doing.
You guys are watching scary movies in the break room, like you're not supposed
to be! Open up! Iwanta donut! Hey! You trying to break in or something? Barb!
Uhno.
I-I was just looking for Lars and Sadie.
But they're not back here.
Uh how did you get in? Well, what kind of mother would I be if I didn't make a
copy of all my daughter's keys?! [Door unlocks.]
I only came over to drop off Sadie's lunch.
She wasn't home last night, so I figured I'd bring it here.
But the place was completely empty.
Maybe it's some sort of baker's holiday.
It's certainly not a federal one.
Sadie never came home last night? Eh, she's an adult.
Probably just snuck off for another "island adventure" with her boyfriend.
That couldn't be.
They were going to go to a party together, but Lars never showed.
And when me and Sadie left, she said she was going home.
And now Sour Cream is looking everywhere for Onion.
And I was expecting a package today from Jamie, but he he never delivered it.
A package? You mean one about yea big, 2 pounds, maybe 4 ounces? [Gasps.]
My distinguished khakis! Did you see Jamie with them? I did this morning just
before sending him off to your place.
Barb, this might be serious.
I'll go see if I can find anyone on the boardwalk.
I'll go check doorsteps for piled-up packages.
Then we'll know if anyone else is missing.
Sadie! Don't worry, honey! Mama's comin' for ya, baby girl! Good luck.
Jamie Onion Lars Sadie? Maybe they're all on vacation? No, Steven.
[Sighs.]
Whatever the case, it's up to me to find them.
Jamie! Onion! [Arcade music plays, games beeping.]
Lars! Sadie! Game 1: Awaiting new challengers to validate me.
Game 2: Somebody, punch me! Please.
[Whirring.]
Well, Sour Cream was right Onion wasn't in the vending machine.
And neither was anybody else.
[Crunch.]
Are you my dad? Aaah! A Gem! Are you my dad? I need to find my dad.
N-No, I-I'm not.
Mm.
[Gasps.]
W-W-Wait! Wait! Don't leave me with another enigma! And the gem was under her
eye our right, her left.
And the wings andyeah.
Connie: I think I made one eye bigger than the other.
Amethyst: I was going for a feeling.
Pearl: Honestly, I can't even draw a circle.
[Chuckles.]
Hmm.
Steven: Okay, Garnet, you just drew yourself.
Uh, I like me.
Well, anyway, I think Connie was the closest.
Thanks! This was a waste of time.
We should be preparing for a fight! Whoever this is, she's from Homeworld.
She's got to be here for us! She's not, though.
She said she's looking for her dad.
What? Her dad? What? There are all these people missing.
Maybe her dad's gone missing, too.
But Gems don't have dads! This doesn't make any sense.
Steven's a Gem, and Steven has a dad.
There are no other Gems like Steven.
Are you sure? We've got to get to the bottom of this.
We should split up and investigate.
[Gasps.]
Ruby and Sapphire! Uh, no.
I meant split into teams.
Oh.
Right.
Garnet with yourself, Pearl with Amethyst, and Connie with me.
Let's go! Connie, do you really think there could be another Gem like me? Well,
you know more about Gems than I do.
But it can't be impossible.
You exist.
Hmm.
She didn't look half human, though.
She was blue andhad wings.
Well, what if she's adopted? What if she crash-landed in the big city and she
was taken in by a lonely millionaire with a heart of gold? And a house of gold.
But one day, he went on a business trip to Beach City and he never came home.
I guess I'd watch the movie of that.
Or read the book.
Or neither, 'cause it could be reality, Steven! You really think so? Hey, the
only way to know is to find out.
Yeah! [Music.]
- Ugh! - Hup! [Wind gusts.]
Yup.
There's wind.
Man.
I feel like I was just here with Onion and all his friends.
Where is he? Poor Sour Cream, missing his brother and Barb missing her daughter
and her mailman and this new Gem missing her dad! I know what it's like to have
your dad taken away.
She must be so scared.
But you got your dad back.
And you'll solve this, too.
We'll solve this together.
Thanks, Connie.
Okay.
Let's turn these woods upside down.
Onion! Lars! [Echoing.]
Jamie! You in here delivering packages to some peat moss? Steven! It's the Gem!
What? She looks just like my drawing! Come on.
You don't have to be afraid.
We'll help you! Jump down into my arms.
My body will break your fall.
Are you my dad? What? No.
I-I'm not your dad.
We can help you find your dad.
I'm not looking for your dad.
I'm looking for my dad.
I need to find my dad.
Right.
Well, we'llhelp you.
Connie! [Grunts.]
Connie, wait! Be careful! Connie.
Are you Connie? Yes! I'm Connie! Me Connie.
Connie friend.
[Laughs.]
Topaz! I found one! I found one! I found a Connie! Steven? Connie! [Grunts.]
[Loud thudding.]
[Crows caw.]
[Thudding continues.]
[Muffled screaming.]
[Whimpering frantically.]
Another Gem! She She has everyone! Let them go! [Muffled screaming,
whimpering.]
[Stomping.]
[Screaming.]
[Muffled screaming.]
Connie! [Grunts.]
Gah! [Panting.]
Look at those organics squirming around.
Give me back my friends! Don't bother listening to that Steven.
He's not my dad.
[Gasps.]
[Giggles.]
Aaaaaah! Ugh! Now all we need is my dad, and we're out of here! [Echoing.]
Can't believe they wasted an Aquamarine on a job like this.
It's so easy, you could have done it yourself, Topaz.
[Giggles.]
[Steven weakly.]
No.
You can't take them.
[Music.]

**** I Am My Mom ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # This is an emergency!
Why is Homeworld stealing humans from the boardwalk? I don't know, but they're
only taking my friends! They even got Connie! If we don't do something, they're
going to take them into space! And our spaceship got jacked, so if they leave
Earth They'll be gone for good.
Ugh! Who were these guys? That little gem I saw before, her name's Aquamarine.
What?! She's got a big friend a fusion, named Topaz.
A topaz fusion and an aquamarine? Are they a big deal? Uh, yes! Blue and Yellow
Diamond must have sent them personally.
The Diamonds? Oh, no.
They must be collecting more humans for the zoo! But there's loads of humans on
Earth.
Why are they only grabbing your friends? Maybe because my friends are the best!
[Cellphone buzzes.]
[Gasps.]
It's from Connie! I know where they are! [Music.]
Stay alert.
They could be anywhere.
Did Connie send you any more pictures? No, nothing.
We know they're here somewhere.
Connie? Lars? Sadie? Onion? [Sighs.]
Why them? [Ringing.]
[Cellphone ringing nearby.]
[Gasps.]
W-Was that Connie's pho [Heavy footsteps.]
Oh, no! [Singsong voice.]
You found us.
[Frantic mumbling.]
Help! Give it up, Aquamarine! There's nowhere to run! [Normal voice.]
Oh, what's this, now? Did you think we were running away? Steven, save yourself
after you save us! Huh.
You know, now that I think about it, this Steven does seem to know everyone on
our list.
The list did come from a Steven, after all.
Maybe you can help us out.
Just let the humans go! Uh, no.
Who are these dullards? We're the Crystal Gems, you chump! Yeah, yeah.
Rose Quartz's old lackeys.
That was in the report, too.
We're not here for any of you rogue gems.
We'll leave you totally alone if you tell us where we can find my dad.
I don't know what you're talking about! Let's see.
Yellow Diamond asked for, uh, my dad, a Connie, a Lars, a Sadie, a mailman, and
an onion, I think.
Six human variations specified in a report by Peridot 5XG.
[Gasps.]
Oh, no, there's lots of humans.
There's my dad, Connie, Lars and Sadie, the mailman, onion I think.
The list.
I gave them the list.
What are you talking about? Aquamarine doesn't have a dad.
She's looking for someone named "my dad!" This is all my fault.
Don't worry about that now.
Our objective's still the same beat the gems Save our friends! Hey, Topaz,
look! They want to lose another fight.
[Growls.]
[Gasps.]
No, Garnet, I've moved on, I swear! Ay! Garnet! That's dirty! My spear can
reach her without hurting the hostages.
Oh, you're so smart.
Goodbye! Whoa! [Grunting.]
This is getting annoying.
Hey, Topaz, can you remind me? I mean, my memory is perfect, but our orders
were to bring back these six humans.
I'm just not sure.
Did they specify alive? You know, I don't think they did.
- Huh? - Jamie.
[Whimpers.]
Steven? I just think, if you care about your friends or whatever, you should
tell me where my dad is, all right? What are we going to do?! Steven! Stop! I
know where you can find my dad.
Ooh! Where? Where?! Right here.
I'm the one you're looking for.
I am my dad! - What? - Huh? I know what you're thinking, Topaz.
It seems a little suspicious that my dad is also a Steven.
But you know if it means getting out of here, I'll believe it.
Steven! Steven, do you know what you're doing? Oh! Hi, Lars.
[Angry muffled shouting.]
Don't worry, I'm gonna bust us all out with my bubble power! Muh-muh! Muh! Her
body's so thick.
[Grunting.]
This might be a little difficult.
[Muffled shouting.]
Time to go.
Uh, Steven, di did you actually have a plan or Just need a minute Very nice
meeting you all, and your compliance is appreciated, but our job here is done,
so [Blows raspberry.]
[Groans.]
[Sighs.]
Let's get back to Homeworld already.
But I'm already on my home world.
I haven't even delivered all the mail today.
Don't worry.
I can do this.
Ohh! You might want to hurry, Steven.
The threat of us perishing in this quagmire of yellow feels very real a real
encompassing kind of real.
A neon death trap, which has imprisoned us so tightly, like a winter coat
that's too big in the sleeves.
Lars, stop! I need to concentrate! Ugh.
If I never get sent on another mission to Earth, it'll be too soon.
What an ordeal.
But the Diamonds needed me.
That's the burden of being the best.
Jamie: What justice is there in such a gross tangling of symbols?! Will you
stop?! You're ruining my moment! - Steven - I almost got it! [Grunting.]
Huh? [Bubbling.]
[All scream.]
What? Topaz! Get this mess cleaned up.
And, Topaz, help her out.
I'm setting a course.
The door! [Music.]
Huh? [Groans.]
Lars! Lars?! [Whimpering.]
[Grunts.]
Steven, let's fuse! We're already in the air.
How are we going to get back? [Gasps.]
Watch out! I'd really appreciate you wrapping it up down there before we exit
the atmosphere.
Come on! Lars, you gotta get up! We gotta move! [Gasps.]
Whoa! Oh! [Grunts.]
Lars! Come on! Help me! Lars! [Grunts.]
[Whimpering.]
Lars.
[Music.]
[Grunts.]
Hey, thanks! Get to the door! Topaz, pull it together and finish this! Steven?
Connie, I'm sorry! What are you [Grunts.]
talking about?! It's my fault you were abducted why everyone was taken.
If it weren't for me, the diamonds wouldn't have come for my friends.
If it weren't for my mom, they wouldn't even be trying to destroy the Earth!
Steven! [Grunts.]
Focus! [Loud clank.]
What now? - The door.
- Right.
Alexandrite! Take us close to the water.
We're gonna jump! - What?! - Huh? Okay.
[Music.]
Uh, go! Go.
Steven, I-I seem to be paralyzed with fear.
Whoa! Nice try.
But it's hopeless, my dad.
I can't go back to Homeworld without getting what the Diamonds want.
I'm not my dad.
- What? - I'm not my dad! How much longer is this mission going to take? Well,
I can end it for you right now.
Oh, really? I'm someone the Diamonds will want more than any of these humans
the leader of the Crystal Gem rebellion the gem that shattered Pink Diamond.
I'm not my dad.
I'm my mom.
I'm Rose Quartz! [Gasps.]
No way.
- Steven? - No.
Don't! Steven! What are you doing?! I get it now.
I'm the only one who can stop what she started.
I can stop all of it! You're wrong! Steven, get down here! She wouldn't have
wanted this.
But I do.
I'm gonna kick your butt if you don't come down here right now! [Music.]
Steven.
Connie: No! Don't you dare! - I love you.
- No! Stop! Steven! [Music.]

**** Stuck Together ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #

Quartz.
Can you believe it? And she just handed herself in.
That's right.
You caught me.
Galactic Criminal Rose Quartz.
I love shattering Diamonds.
I just want to shatter 'em all the time.
You think shattering's bad? Wait till the Diamonds get their hands on you.
At least everyone else is safe.
What are you doing? Let go of me! [Grunting.]
- Steven! - What the Lars! Oh! Looks like we got one of the humans anyway.
Don't know what we'll do with just one of them, but I guess that's for the
Diamonds to decide.
Wait.
Aquamarine, the deal is off.
You were only supposed to take me.
No humans.
That's a human.
[Grunting.]
Oh, no.
Is Rosie upset 'cause her widdle "deal" didn't work? Look.
I'm so moved, I'm crying.
[Laughs.]
Just kidding.
That's my gem.
Topaz, what do you think? Should we let her friend go? I agree.
[Laughs.]
Go on.
Do your thing.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not again.
I'll go let the Diamonds know about our little prisoner.
Say, Rose, how do I look? Awful, small, and mean! [Laughs.]
Is that how you flattered so many Gems into joining your rebellion? How cute.
Topaz, I trust you'll still be able to fly the ship despite your you know.
additions? [Laughs.]
Lars: Steven, this is all your fault.
All this weird alien stuff this is 'cause of you, isn't it? Yes, of course it
is! That's why I turned myself in to save all of you! Well, it didn't really
work out too well, did it? Well, everyone else managed to get off the ship.
So, where were you? I ran and hid, Steven, like any sensible person would do if
they wanted to get trapped on a ship.
Oh.
Lars.
Sadie was in trouble, and I didn't do anything.
Actually, wait.
I did do something.
I ran and hid just like I always do.
Just like I ran from the potluck.
But you were abducted.
That's not your fault.
No, I trashed my roll and ran away.
Then I was abducted.
Oh, why couldn't I just let people eat my food?! [Sighs.]
We have to get you out of here.
Here, just leave it to me.
Hey! Look! You have Rose Quartz! Why bother with him? He's worthless! Thanks a
lot, Steven.
No! I meant like "worth less", not "worthless" like relative to me.
[Sighs.]
At least I make a great seat cushion.
You feeling cozy, you big banana? I don't think she's listening.
Can you hear me, you What was it Jamie said? You dangerous yellow coat? Of
course she can't hear you, Steven.
She's got those big headphones on.
[Sighs.]
[Rumbling.]
[Grunting.]
[Sighs.]
Those Crystal Gems must have screwed up the engine during takeoff.
Topaz, go fix it.
Lars, look for something that can help us.
[Grunts.]
[Beeps.]
[Gasps.]
A destabilizer.
That's perfect! A destaba-what? It's a weapon that disrupts a Gem's physical
form.
Cool.
Thanks for explaining.
I still don't know what that means.
Just hear me out.
I have a plan.
I'm gonna need you to be my arms.
Ugh.
Fine.
Lars, pull my pants off.
What?! Trust me! I'm trying to save you.
What if I don't want to be saved? What if I want to stay trapped here and fly
around space, and why your pants, you weirdo?! Just do it! [Pants unzip.]
Ugh.
There.
I did it.
Great.
Now tie one of the legs into a lasso.
I can't.
They're on the floor.
What are they doing on the floor?! I don't know, Steven.
What are we doing in space? Lars, pick them up and then tie them into a lasso.
Ugh.
Fine.
Wow.
It worked.
We're back home.
Great plan.
[Sighs.]
Now lasso the destabilizer.
I still don't know what that is.
That.
That thing.
Come on, Lars.
You can do it.
Ugh.
Fine.
[Grunts weakly.]
Come on.
Just one more try.
I don't want to try again.
Lars, throw the lasso! Fine! What is your problem, Lars?! Why did you do that?!
Why do you think I'm capable of anything?! You think I can do all this stuff,
but I can't! I can't because I'm a wuss, Steven.
I'm just [sniffles.]
afraid.
I've always just been stupid and afraid.
Not like you.
You're always helping people.
You're never afraid.
[Sniffles.]
Lars I'm afraid right now.
I thought if I turned myself in, it'd fix everything, but I don't want to do
this, Lars.
I've been to space before, but not like this.
They're taking me straight to their terrible leaders that want to destroy Earth
and destroy me for something I never even did.
I just wanted to save everyone, but I couldn't even do that because, look
you're still here.
Steven.
I'm sorry.
I don't know how I'm gonna get you out of this.
We'll figure it out.
We've got like a billion light-years till we get there, right? For the first
time ever, you're gonna look on the bright side? Y-You don't have to sugarcoat
this, but come on, you never do that.
You're always real with me about how much everything sucks.
Okay.
You're right.
This is really, really messed up, Steven.
You know what's even more messed up? Even though you're in huge trouble and
it's all my fault I'm kind of glad you're here.
I I don't want to be alone right now.
[Sobs.]
Isn't that awful? Dude, at this point, everything is awful.
[Chuckles.]
[Both chuckle.]
I'd give you a hug, but I can't use my arms.
I could try using my legs, but it might be weird.
[Crying.]
That's so, so beautiful.
[Sniffles.]
Even in the clutches of certain doom, you're happy to have each other.
[Gasps.]
T-T-Topaz.
I don't know what Topaz would do if she didn't have Topaz.
I've always wanted to tell me how I'm helping me through this, but there's
always someone between us! They're always sending me on these miserable
missions.
I'm always pretending I'm fine with it.
[Sniffles.]
I have to pretend I'm fine.
But you two you're so honest and open so [sniffles.]
I want to help you guys.
What do you need? A way off this ship.
And my pants.
All right.
You can use this escape pod.
I'll set the coordinates for Earth.
All right, Lars, just get in and let it do its thing.
Guh.
What are you talking about? You're coming, right? I can't.
I turned myself in.
I still got to go.
Someone's got to pay for what my mom did.
But you don't want to do this? Dude, forget it.
Let's just go.
- I - Aquamarine: Topaz, what are you still doing down here, you big boulder?
We're almost to Homeworld.
[Gasps.]
What are you doing? Look, I can explain.
Um, they had this whole heartfelt thing about being there for each other, and
you missed it.
It was so moving.
[Gasps.]
No! Wait! I can't see what's happening.
Are we still escaping? No! Nobody's escaping! Aquamarine, let's talk about
this.
Yeah, I-I bet you don't really want to hurt us.
You You probably just act mean because deep down you're afraid you're weak.
Go ahead.
Let it out.
We're all sharing right now.
Topaz, you had one job, and if you're not gonna do it, you're of no use to me!
[Whimpers.]
Ooh! So a revolt, huh? And what do you plan to do after this? Go back to the
Diamonds? My gem in your hand? I'm sure they'll love that.
You'll be rewarded handsomely by being separated and shattered.
[Clatters.]
[Thuds.]
What was I thinking? That's the problem with you fusions.
Sooner or later, you all become sentimental.
[Rumbles.]
We're here.
Look, just unfuse, and we'll never speak of this again.
[Steven and Lars grunting.]
Topaz, you don't have to do this.
[Grunting continues.]
Wait.
Lars! - Steven, where are they taking us?! - I don't know! - Steven! - Lars!

****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e02 Episode Script ******
**** The Trial ****
I know my mom did something really bad.
Whatever Homeworld has in store for me I'm ready! I said, I'm ready! It's me
Rose Quartz! Hello? Anybody? Lars, are you there? Is this the punishment? Come
on! I know it's going to be worse than this! So whatever you're gonna do would
you just do it already? This is ridiculous! 4,000 years of loyal service to the
court, and this is what I get? Oh, I'm the unluckiest Zircon in the galaxy!
Wait, are you - Rose Quartz? - Yeah.
- Really? - It's a long story.
Then I don't have time for it.
Ugh! We only have this brief moment to prepare your case.
- Case? - Ugh! Who am I kidding?! This is pointless! We've all heard the rumors
about the demise of Pink Diamond, but I can't believe these files! Shattered by
one of her own soldiers ha! In front of her entire entourage! And look at you
now! That ridiculous disguise is only going to make you - look more guilty! -
That's fine, because I am! Well, don't say that especially not when you're out
there! Out where?! What's going to happen!? What did you think was going to
happen, Rose Quartz?! As soon as that door opens, you're going on trial! Oh.
Defending a rebel? Isn't that treason? I was assigned to this! All rise for the
luminous Yellow Diamond! And the lustrous Blue Diamond.
Where is the accused? Is that Rose Quartz? Look at this hideous form she's
taken.
Forget the trial.
We should shatter her just for looking like that.
No! I want to hear her make her case.
I want to know what she thinks we're going to do with her, because I want to do
something worse.
Fine! Let's just get on with it, shall we? My Diamond.
My brilliant, opulent, radiant, glimmering "My Diamond" will suffice, or we'll
never get through this.
Of course, My Diamond.
Rose Quartz committed a crime so unprecedented that one can't help but wonder
why? Exhibit "A.
" - Lars! - Steven! What's going on here?! Where are we?! Who are those huge,
giant ladies?! As we can see from this specimen humans are loud, absolutely
hideous creatures that serve no purpose whatsoever.
What sort of Gem would turn on her own kind for this? I'll tell you what kind
that kind.
Just let him go! He's got nothing to do with this! There it is the passion, the
fury that caused the diabolical Rose Quartz to shatter her own diamond! But I
know what you're thinking "This thing doesn't look like a Rose Quartz.
" And for that, I would like to call an eyewitness! Oh, Eyeball! Do not address
me, war criminal! I'm just glad you're okay.
I heard it straight from her.
She said "I'm the mighty Rose Quartz.
I've got her shield and everything.
" And then she threw me into space! I tried to help you! I healed your Gem! And
who else has the ability to heal Gems other than the villainous Rose Quartz?!
And there you have it! Rose Quartz did it, and that's Rose Quartz.
I rest my case.
Oh, she's good.
Well, I'm convinced! Time to execute! Not yet.
The defense still has to speak.
Right! Well, uh Before I start, my very, uh, thought-out defense, I'd like to
remind the court that Rose Quartz did turn herself in.
The Court remembers, and the Court does not care.
Uh, of course.
Uh, in innocent! Uh, the word "innocent" can mean, - oh, many different things.
- I did it! Wha What, what! Stop! No! I want to hear what she has to say.
Get us out of here, Steven! Uh State your name for the record, please! I, um I
am Rose Quartz and I'm guilty.
Wait! No, don't say that! Everything you guys said I did, I did.
And I did it by myself.
I'm sorry.
I'll accept any punishment you want to give me.
Just let him go! And leave the Earth alone.
Ha! Sounds like a solid confession to me! How? How did you do it? Huh? How did
you shatter Pink Diamond? Um, well I did it on Earth in front of Pink Diamond's
palanquin.
I was probably like "Stop!" And she was all like, "No!" So we fought I think.
And she probably did some cool moves.
I probably did some cool stuff, too, some jump kicks and stuff.
But I was most likely deeply conflicted about deciding to shatter her.
Definitely crying.
I probably had to use the Breaking Point to do it.
It was a sword! You shattered her with a sword! That's quite enough testimony
from you! We shall take a short recess.
What are you saying in there?! "Maybe" this, "probably" that! Oh, what do you
mean probably?! Look, I just I don't actually know how it happened, okay? You
don't know?! - I - Don't tumble my rocks! Both our Gems are on the line! - Did
you do this or not?! - It was me, all right! Rose Quartz did it, and I've got
her Gem, so I'm the one who's gotta pay for this! You don't know how it
happened.
I get it.
There's a reason they want you to explain how you did it.
Huh? It's because it doesn't make sense! Rose Quartz is flawed, I grant you.
A shallow strata Gem who turned on her own kind out of a misguided attachment
to a planet and creatures like these.
What?! Huh?! It's indisputable that as the diamond overseeing Earth, Pink was
Rose Quartz's enemy.
Rose had everything to gain by shattering her.
But even though she may have wanted to shatter Pink Diamond, could she? Blue
Diamond, for the purpose of this argument, may I present your palanquin? Is
this necessary? Isn't it? Please, proceed.
Now, as the records show, Pink Diamond was shattered just outside a palanquin
much like this.
Witnesses said, Pink had stepped out and had taken only a few steps forward,
when Rose attacked her from the front.
Oh! The question no one seems to be asking is "how?" I've been asking that
question.
A-a-a-and right you are to ask, My Diamond! B-because, at the time that Pink
was shattered, Rose Quartz had been a recognized threat for several hundred
years.
There were no Rose Quartz soldiers in her entourage, and none in her guard.
So how did a Rose Quartz, with no business being anywhere near Pink Diamond,
get so close in the first place? Where were Pink Diamond's attendants? Her
Agates, her Sapphires? And where was her Pearl? They were with her, of course.
They saw the whole thing! But none of them saw Rose Quartz approach? Wouldn't
her Sapphires have seen Rose Quartz coming? Wouldn't her Agates have tried to
fight her off? That is strange! She must have slipped past them! Even if she
did, wouldn't her Pearl have cried out in alarm, "Watch out, my Diamond!" No,
whoever did this was already close to Pink Diamond, someone her guards would
allow to get near her, someone she would listen to when asked to stop her
palanquin and step outside, and someone with the authority to cover it up
afterwards! Someone with supreme authority! Someone like one of you! Uh,
disregard that last statement! I might have gotten carried away.
Case closed, right, My Diamond? Yellow, stop it! Why are you doing this?! This
is our chance! We gotta go! - Where?! - We don't need - to listen to this
nonsense! - There! Let's shatter Rose Quartz and be done with it! Can't you
restrain yourself?! - But this is pointless! - No, it's not! Hurry up and drive
this thing! Those giant crazy chicks aren't gonna be distracted forever! Where
is this? Homeworld.
You think you can get away, Rose? You stood your ground on that little speck
called Earth but you're on our world now.

Lars, are you okay? Thanks to your bubble [groans.]
my bones are only a little broken.
[Chuckles.]
My bones, too.
[Groans.]
Dude, those giant ladies were furious with you.
They're the diamonds.
They've been after my mom for 6,000 years, and now they're after me.
Come on.
We got to move.
How are we supposed to get off this planet? Do you even know where you're
going? No.
This is my first time here, too.
[Groans.]
This is so messed up.
What are we gonna eat? There's tons of food if you like rocks for dinner.
Salt is a rock, right? Maybe we can season some dirt and make a meal.
Wait! [Low rumbling.]
Uh Sorry.
[Both gasp.]
They found us! - Run! - Wait! If we stand perfectly still, it won't see us! I
saw it in a movie once.
That sounds good.
Uh We should probably move! - Aah! - Aah! I think that movie was about
dinosaurs.
Lars, come on! Whoa! [Music.]
What are we gonna do? What's gonna happen? We're gonna run, and we're gonna be
okay! No! You just don't get it! I hate being scared all the time! I was scared
of everything except baking.
Actually, I was scared of that, too.
I never even tried making baklava 'cause it looked so hard! I never had the
guts to stick up for anybody not even me! And now I'm hiding again like a big
cowardly loser under some space building! Don't beat yourself up like that,
Lars.
That's what the killer robots are for.
- Quickly! - Down here! Steven! What if it's a trap? Uh I don't think we have a
choice! Aah! [Both sigh.]
Close one, huh? Yeah, but who Rutile Right: Don't worry.
You're safe now.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Thank you, whoever you [Screams.]
[Both gasp.]
It's okay, Lars.
Thank you for saving us.
How bizarre.
What are they? They certainly don't look like gems we've ever seen before.
Come, this way! This way, come! Steven, wait.
Is this really a good idea? They seemdifferent.
I think we can trust them.
[Music.]
Uh, excuse me, but, um, where are you taking us? Somewhere long forgotten.
Where only those who don't belong belong.
[Chuckles.]
Sounds like my kind of place.
You don't happen to have any fast-food joints around there, do you? Whoa! What
is this place? [Echoing.]
A kindergarten.
A really, really big one.
[Both whistle.]
We're back! Here we are! It's okay to come out! Oh, thank goodness.
I hope you weren't followed.
You weren't, right? You double-checked? [Gasps.]
You've been followed! Uh, hi! Uh, don't worry.
I'm not a threat or anything.
Rutile Left: It's okay, Rhodonite.
Relax.
We brought them here.
They're with us.
Can we trust them? - Sure.
- I think so.
- Everyone! - Huh? A wondrous vision has appeared before me.
The twins of rutile will bring one no, two strangers to our current place of
hiding.
We know, Padparadscha.
Your prediction already happened.
They were being chased up on the surface by one of those terrible robonoids.
Don't tell me you tried to fight those things.
No, no.
Of course not.
These two were about to be scanned when we pulled them under.
We were just in time.
Fluorite: Let me see.
[Lars screams.]
Uh Aah! They don't look like Gems.
That's what I said! I said the same thing! Hi! I'm Steven.
I'm a Gem.
Well, half-gem.
And this is Lars.
He's all human.
That's why you look so unusual.
We look unusual?! Of course you do! You can't just walk around on the surface
like that! You're off-color just like the rest of us! What do you mean, off-
color? You know, wrong.
Not, right.
Flawed.
Wait, I don't see anything wrong with you guys.
Gems like us aren't needed.
Padparadscha can only predict things that just happened.
Here comes Fluorite! And a fusion like me is unforgivable.
When my our Morganite found out, let's just say we were replaced.
But my story's nothing! I mean, Fluorite, how many Gems are you now? Six.
Maybe more, if we meet the right Gem.
And then there's us! You mean, you're not a fusion? We're just a rutile that
came out wrong.
We survived because all the other rutiles ran away when we emerged.
We survived because they were afraid of us.
Afraid of you? So you've been hiding your whole lives.
- What happens if they find you? - We'll be Shattered.
[Low rumbling.]
- Oh.
- No! Oh.
[Whimpers.]
Ah! You were followed! They're gonna find us! They're gonna break us! This is
our fault! If it wasn't for us, you'd be fine! We couldn't just leave you
there.
We had to do something.
Steven? What're we gonna do? Everyone hide! Careful, everyone! We're about to
be found! [Music.]
Lars It's okay to be afraid.
Okay.
[Gasps.]
Oh, no! - We got to do something! - Lars! [Music.]
- [Gasps.]
Lars! - It's okay to be afraid.
[Sighs.]
Oh, my gosh! Lars! They were trying to scan your Gem! They can't see you at
all! All right! Looks like the tables have turned! - Human Lars.
- [Gasps.]
I've been possessed by the most marvelous vision! Huh? You, human Lars, are
Gemless, and will be safe from the robonoids, which only target Gems! I think
that's the coolest thing I've ever done in my life.
It's not over yet.
[Grunts.]
Huh? Oh.
The shield is reflective.
Padparadscha, come back! Hide! Okay.
Okay.
Okay! Whoa-oh-oh! Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Eat this! Lars! Lars? Lars? I didn't think
we were gonna make it! - That was amazing! - Lars, that was so great.
- You were amazing.
- We're winning! We're winning! [Gasps.]
[Crying.]
[Groans.]
Whoa.
What happened? Oh, my! Something incredible is going to happen to Lars!

**** Lars' Head ****
[Music.]
[Groans.]
What the heck just happened? Lars! You saved us! You stopped the Robonoids, but
but one of them exploded, and and you weren't moving, and I started crying.
[Gasps.]
I brought you back to life! It was an accident.
I mean, I probably would've done that on purpose if I had known I could do
that, but I didn't really ask your permission, so I'm sorry.
Back to life? So I was away from life? Aah! I'm pink! Ah! I know.
Do you feel okay? I don't really know.
- But your body, are you sore? - No.
- Are you tired? - No.
- Do you feel good? - No.
- Do you feel bad? - No! I guess I just feel really freaked out.
Well, I am, too, so at least we're on the same page here.
[Whooshing.]
They're back.
Those shattering Robonoids are back! Quickly.
Block the entrance.
- Lars, you stay here and rest.
- All right.
I predict Lars will change in hue.
What a mystery! [All grunting.]
Whoa, strong.
[Steven grunting.]
Is this gonna be enough? [Whirring.]
They seem to have overlooked us for the time being.
Quickly, block the entrance! As long as I'm here, they're gonna keep coming
after us.
It's true.
This was a horrible plan.
Should we try to find a new hiding spot? No, no, no! If we leave this cavern,
we'll be completely exposed.
But if we stay here, they'll find us for sure.
So, we either stay here and get caught Or we go out there and get caught.
So, wait, am I a zombie now? No.
Wellno! You can talk, and zombies can't do that.
I must've healed you.
I've healed people before, just never this much.
Just admit it, Steven! I'm a zombie! Oh, I know.
A zombie wouldn't have a heartbeat.
[Heart beating slowly.]
That's, uh, pretty slow.
But I think we can rule out pink zombie.
Thank the stars.
What's a zombie? I can't believe humans just change color like this.
They don't.
Well, I guess if you get really cold, you turn blue, and if you get really
embarrassed, you turn red.
So what does pink mean? Is Lars gonna explode or something? Maybe then Lars
will reform with a different color.
I'm sure whatever color Lars chooses will be lovely.
But why am I pink? [Groans.]
Even your hair is different.
Aah! What was that? Huh? It, like, lit up, right? You saw it, too.
Uh, yeah.
What did you do? Do it again.
Why is it doing that? Lars, I think I know what this is.
There's something I can try, but no.
You don't want me going in your head.
You're going to possess me again? No.
It would be more literal.
- Then what is it? - Forget it.
Look, Steven, I'm not gonna get mad, okay? I trust you.
Just help me out here.
If I've got magic hair now, I want to know.
Everyone stand back.
All right, now just bend down.
Like this? Now, you might feel a slight foot in your head.
Wait, what? [Grunting.]
[All gasp.]
What is happening? They're fusing! They're fusing, right? You're doing great,
Lars.
Uh, okay.
[Inhales deeply.]
[Music.]
[Gasps.]
Ah.
I'm home.
I'm home! Guys? Where are they? Water! Ahh.
[Gulping.]
Ahh.
[Stomach gurgles.]
[Gasps.]
Food.
Life is beautiful! Got to bring some back for Lars.
Wish I could tell everyone I'm okay.
Oh, Lion.
So you were [Sighs.]
Gosh, there there's so much I want to ask you.
If only you could talk.
Thanks, buddy.
[Gasps.]
- Aah! - Aah! [Groans.]
Sorry, Lars.
So what happened? What's in my head? - Home.
- Wha? Everyone, I've made an amazing discovery! I just traveled back to planet
Earth by going through Lars' head! You went back to Earth? What the heck? Is my
head like a wormhole? No, it's way simpler than that.
You see, I have a pink pet lion who belonged to my mom when she was still here,
and it turns out I can go into his mane, and it transports me to a magical
dimension where my mom kept a bunch of artifacts on a hill with a tree, and for
some reason, I can't breathe in there.
But anyway, when I went into Lars' head, I got transported to the same magical
dimension, but it was a new part of it, but since the two are connected, I
could reach the portal that leads out of Lion's mane, which is back on Earth!
Uh Here, I brought you some food.
Huh? Thanks, but I-I'll save it for later.
But aren't you hungry? Maybe you only eat magical lizards now like Lion.
A-Are you hungry for lizards? No, I do not want a lizard.
But you haven't eaten in days.
I know.
There must be pink magic in my guts now or something.
What is this box? It's juice.
We drink it back on Earth.
- What? - That's impossible.
- There's no way.
- Unh-unh.
Steven's back.
That can't be.
I'm incredulous.
Why can't it be? Everyone knows that the Earth Was decimated by the Diamond
attack! Sorry.
It's not like that.
The Diamonds did attack, but there are still Gems living on Earth, and the
planet's full of life.
It grew the potatoes that became these chips and grew the wheat that eventually
became the flour that eventually became the bread that eventually became this
sandwich! - Sand - Wich? But why would Gems still live there? Because the Earth
is a place where we can be ourselves.
We can live freely without having to hide who we are.
Live freely? Without having to hide? That sounds wonderful.
It is.
And now that we have this portal, we can all go there.
All? How am I supposed to go through my own head? Oh.
Hmm.
[Grunting.]
[Grunting.]
[Grunting.]
[Grunting.]
Stop! You're gonna break my elbow! Okay, so that didn't work, but I'm sure
there's another way.
No, no, look.
I get it.
Everyone just go, and I'll stay here.
There's no other way out.
I'm it.
The Earth is way better than this.
There's no robots flying around.
Just seagulls that fly in front of the sunset and it's beautiful! Just go,
you'll see.
I took it for granted, so don't pass up this chance.
Well, if you insist.
We won't do it.
Not if it means leaving you behind.
What?! I'm trying to perform a beautiful act over here.
We know this planet.
We've been hiding in these tunnels for eons.
You'll need us to help you get around.
Besides, us off colors stick together.
We'll get to Earth another way.
We'll find an alternate route.
But you've got to go back.
But it doesn't feel right to just leave you here.
You said yourself that everyone on this planet is out to get you.
You won't be safe until you're back on Earth.
But, Lars Don't argue with me! You're always trying to help me.
You brought me back to life.
Just let me be somebody who deserved it.
All right, I'll tell everyone you're okay.
I'll be back.
I can bring whatever you need.
- Be careful, okay? - We will.
We can't leave without Lars! We'll see you on Earth, I hope.
No, no, no.
We will! [Music.]
Um, if you could just Oh, yeah.
This is hopeless.
[Gasps.]
We'll never get that dropship to fly, and we're losing time! Who knows what
they're doing to Steven.
Hi, Steven.
What are we going to d I'm back! [Music.]
[Laughs.]

****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e05 Episode Script ******
**** Dewey Wins ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # Steven: We'll be fine!
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna walk Connie out.
Don't worry! I'm not going back into space or anything.
[Laughs.]
They're never gonna let me out of their sight again.
Connie? Connie! I know you got to get home and get some sleep, but once you're
all rested up, I can't wait to tell you about everything! Being on Homeworld
was crazy! After I turned myself in, they put me on trial! And Lars was there.
We got chased by killer robots.
[Chuckles.]
What a wild ride that was.
And uhI'm really happy to see you again.
Umm a-are you happy to see me, too? Of course I'm happy to see you, Steven.
Uh, but? But how could you just give yourself up like that? Well, first, I said
I was my dad, and then I said I was my mom.
[Scoffs.]
No.
I mean, you just gave up.
I had to.
They were gonna take all those people.
They were gonna take you! But what about our training? Stevonnie.
Jam buds.
I believed in us.
We could have done it together.
This is different.
This whole thing was my fault, but I knew that I could fix it all if I turned
myself in.
And look No one got hurt.
Well, except for Lars, but I saved him, too.
But I'm hurt.
No, you're not.
You're safe.
You're here.
I'm here.
We're safe.
Everything's fine.
It's not, though.
You know, it was a tough decision for me to make, but it had to be done.
- You don't get it.
- Get what? Let's go, Lion.
[Roars.]
"Wow, Steven, that was so brave of you.
I'm so glad you're back.
" What?! And Lars is still in space?! Yeah, he is, but don't worry, he's with
some very nice gems who are on the run from their Homeworld overlords.
Oh, Laaaars.
Sadie, he's fine.
We can go see him anytime through Lion.
Glad he's not At least he's some kind of alive.
You told his parents, right? You're kind of my practice run for that.
[Bell dings.]
[Sighs.]
Let's do this quick.
I can't be away from work too long.
I'm basically their only employee now.
[Shouting, booing.]
Whoa, what's going on? Man: We're sick of it! Am I right about it?! Aliens
nearly abducted the whole town.
And what did Mayor "Billiam" Dewey do about it? That is right.
Jack and squat! [All shouting.]
Steven, I'm going to Lars's parents' house.
Okay, I'll catch up with you.
And that is why you should vote for me, your favorite Nanefua, for mayor of
Beach City! [All cheering.]
When I say "Do we want Dewey?" you say "No.
" - Do we want Dewey? - All: No! - Do we want Dewey? - All: No! Nanefua: Okay,
good job.
Hmm.
"Can't hang today.
Mayor D's getting blamed for Gem stuff, and it's totally my fault.
" I don't know, Universe.
This doesn't look good.
- How's this? - Oh.
That looks great.
But I may need more.
My gosh.
I've never had an opponent before.
Even when I ran for mayor of high school, I ran unopposed.
Probably because I made up the position.
If only I could've warned you about this abduction stuff sooner, then
everything would be fine now.
I really dropped the ball.
You're right, Universe.
This is all your fault.
Huh.
How about we call an impromptu town meeting on the boardwalk? I'll tell
everyone what happened and how you weren't involved at all, and everyone'll
feel better and vote for you in the next election.
All right, Universe.
The ball's back in your court.
Just, uh don't drop it again, huh? So, in conclusion, Mayor Dewey had nothing
whatsoever to do with the abductions.
Everything was my fault because I unknowingly provided some space Gems with a
list of names and put everyone in danger.
Mayor Dewey would never do anything to purposefully endanger the town.
He basically just keeps a low profile and doesn't get involved in much of
anything.
Yeah, maybe he should be involved! He's the mayor! [Crowd booing.]
Thanks for listening, and please vote for him in the next Beach City mayoral
election.
Oh, ho, ho, yeah! Hello, everyone.
Thanks for coming.
Wow! This whole abduction business was a real close call, huh? Whoo.
But look around you.
Everyone is safe and accounted for.
That's not true! What about my friend Lars? Who? What? Lars! Lars Barriga?! Mr.
And Mrs.
Barriga's son! Did you even know he was still missing? Did you know he was
still somewhere in space?! What kind of mayor doesn't know when his own people
- are lost in space?! - The donut boy? Is that why the donut shop was closed
this morning? - Yeah, but - Do not worry.
I will do everything in my power to hire a new donut boy.
[Crowd booing.]
No! You've got to be kidding me! How did this get on the Internet so fast? I
didn't invite any press to this event.
Someone posted it on Tube-Tube.
Only 12 people have seen it.
12 people?! That's half the town! I'm finished, Universe.
I don't know of many political figures that have made a comeback after getting
a tomato to the face.
Oh, again, and again, and again, and again.
You need to stop looping that.
Look, we're gonna get through this together, okay? Tomorrow is the big debate.
You still have one more chance to win back the town's love.
But Steven, some of the things people have been saying about me are really
painful and mean.
We've just got to change the conversation.
We can start with this.
"How to talk to people"? I'm going to get you ready for that debate, even if it
takes all night.
[Crowd murmuring.]
All right.
[Yawns.]
Today's the day.
You got your note cards, you look great, and if anyone brings up the alien
invasion thing, I wrote a bunch of Ocean Town jokes for you to use.
Aww, shucks, Universe.
You're like the son I never had.
Youhave a son.
I know that.
You're just very different from him, is all.
[Crowd chanting "speech".]
[Whines.]
I'm rooting for you, Dew Drops.
[Weakly.]
Thanks.
[Chanting continues.]
[Chanting stops.]
[Clears throat.]
[Microphone feedback.]
People of Beach City.
You might think that being a mayor is a fine and glamorous sort of thing.
I can understand why my opponent would want the position.
But I've been mayor of this city for a decade, and I know some things that Ms.
Nanefua does not.
You see, when you're the mayor, you get blamed for everything.
When the boardwalk has termites, it's the mayor's fault.
When aliens steal people, it's the mayor's fault.
When the mayor crashes the mayor mobile into the only cell tower in town, it's
the mayor's fault.
Most people can't handle that kind of pressure, but I can.
So, I say to you, Beach City citizens, just enjoy our wonderful ocean breeze
and don't worry about a thing.
Just let Dewey "do" it for you! [Crowd murmuring, applause.]
Nice.
You know, Mayor Dewey, you are right.
I am? A-About what? I have blamed you for too many things, and that is not
helping.
[Crowd murmuring.]
What? Blaming our problems completely on the mayor is not getting us anywhere.
When one of us suffers, the town suffers.
When you suffer, Mayor Billiam, the town suffers.
So, no longer will I point my fingers at you.
I will extend all my fingers on both my hands to everyone here today and ask
that we share responsibility for the welfare and safety of Beach City,
together! Thank you.
[Cheers and applause.]
[Chanting "Nanefua".]
You got this, Mayor Dewey.
[Stammering.]
Uh, did you ever notice how people from Ocean Town Oh, who am I kidding? Beach
City deserves a real mayor.
Someone wise and collected like Ms.
Nanefua.
[Crowd murmuring.]
Wait.
No, no, no.
I withdraw from the race.
You can find the key to the city under the city welcome mat.
[Cheers and applause.]
[Sighs.]
Mayor Dewey, what're you doing?! Y-You can't just throw the election like that.
W-We could still win! Well, I know it's not very traditional to do that in the
middle of a debate, but why drag it out? We could have won! I-I really believed
in you! - I really believed in us! - Well, you were wrong.
- What do you want me to say? - How about, "I'm sorry.
We were in this together, and I let you down.
" Come on, Universe.
You know she's gonna be a better mayor than me.
It was the right thing to do.
I guess, but I still feel betrayed.
That's probably how Connie feels.
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about, but I've got to find a new job.
[Humming.]
[Tapping, phone dialing.]
[Dialing continues.]

**** Gemcation ****
Steven: "Hey, Connie.
How are you today? Hope everything's going okay.
It'd be cool if you told me it was I guess I miss you.
I know yesterday I said, 'I guess,' but I mean, I do miss you Hope you didn't
get your phone mixed up with a tennis ball.
Ha ha.
" A tennis ball? Really, Universe? [Sighs.]
Help! Ah! Yah! Back! Ugh! Hey, uh, Stevearoni, ugh, want to help your old Pa
over here? Uh, yeah, Dad, one sec.
## Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm on it.
[Grunts.]
Are you good? Are you safe? Do you still love me? Yeah, of of course, buddy.
It's just some hoses.
I can buy new ones.
I still have like $9 million left, and what better way to spend that than on
some hoses, right, kiddo? Yeah, Dad.
[Cellphone vibrates.]
[Gasps.]
Ronaldo: Steven! So.
Did you ever get around to watching the "Koala Princess" box set I lent you
three months ago? [Sighs.]
Hey, is everything okay? You're looking a little glum.
- I am a little glum.
- Do you want to talk about it? Um, it's just space lag from when I went to
space.
Hmm.
[Sighs.]
[Cellphone vibrates.]
Ah! Wait.
No.
I need to play it cool.
Ronaldo: I'm just gonna assume by your silence that you're entangled within the
immersive koala lore of the show.
Did you get to the part where Koala Princess and Kanga-Roofus kiss? Greg:
Steven, you want to help us with these groceries? Coming.
Eh? Eh? [Voice muffled.]
Check this out, Steven.
[Normal voice.]
It's farm fresh.
Uh, thanks guys, but the fridge is full.
Not the fridge at our vacation house.
- Whoo! - Vacation.
I thought, "Why spend money on hoses when I can spend it on houses?" So I found
a place we could rent for the weekend by searching online.
Back in the old days we just went door-to-door hoping one was unlocked, but
this is the new days.
Okay.
Well, have fun.
Uh, Steven, you're going on vacation, too.
[Coughs.]
Oh, yes.
This is the perfect time for a vacation.
I mean, how often are we on the same planet together? Yeah.
And you'll be with your favorite Gems and your favorite dad.
Agree with Amethyst.
Turn to Steven.
Steven, you should go.
No, with more enthusiasm.
Steven, it's a vacation! I mean, I would, but I'm really tied up with something
important.
Ronaldo: In the end, the wombats were for naught, but it really makes you
think.
I'll go.
Aced it.
Greg: Here it is, temporary home sweet temporary home.
- Is that my bed? - Yeah.
I want you to be a comfortable as possible, finally have some family time.
I feel like you haven't had that in a while.
Yeah, maybe.
This place is great.
They have one of those refrigerators that dispense water, not to mention four
windows and an analog clock! Hmm, says here we can't use the water dispenser or
the clock.
Windows must be kept closed at all times, and remove all shoes before entering.
Hmm.
Hey, Greg, did you invite anyone else, party guy, about three feet long,
hissing, reptilian? No.
Well, you might want to factor in a plus one.
- Oh! Party guy, no! - I promise.
It's gonna be a really good time.
It's a great place, Dad.
It only bit Pearl once, but, like, we're Gems.
She'll be okay.
[Groans.]
It isn't the pain.
It's the surprise.
Hey, Amethyst, do you think you could Yeah.
Hey, Steven.
Hi, Amethyst.
Man, you can see the stars so clearly out here.
It's pretty, huh? Huh? Uh, I don't know.
- It's okay.
- Hey, hey.
It's okay if it isn't okay.
- The sky? - Yeah.
- What? - I don't know.
So, uh, you really into phones now? No.
[Owl hoots.]
Hey, Schtuball, won't you take my place? I've been in here way too long.
I'm gonna become a raisin.
Steven, you should join me.
Become a raisin.
Okay, but one sec.
Steven, I know what's troubling you.
You do? Gosh.
I really messed up, didn't I? You didn't do anything wrong.
Pink Diamond was a villain.
It was 5,750 years ago.
Pink Diamond was ravishing the planet.
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh.
Pink Diamond was bad.
Everything bad had to happen so good things could kind of happen.
Uh, good.
You understand.
Buzz.
Buzz.
At least wiggle a little.
Greg: Come on.
Can't you give it another shot? Amethyst: What are we supposed to do? He just
doesn't want to talk about it.
But I know it's not space lag.
This is some Gem thing he knows I won't understand.
I don't know anything about Homeworld.
I don't know anything about your society.
Whatever horrible things he saw out there, you guys have to put it into
context.
If Steven won't talk to us, then the help we can give him is limited.
We've all tried to coax it out of him except for Me? But I have no idea what
Homeworld is like now.
Pearl, please.
He knows you know about space stuff.
It can't hurt to try.
Mm.
[Music.]
Huh.
It sure is quiet out here, huh? - Yeah.
- So, Homeworld I always hoped you'd see it some day, but I thought I'd be
there with you.
Being taken there as a prisoner, I suppose it was something of a dramatic
experience.
It's just, Steven, I'm sure you have a lot of questions you'd like answers to,
like about the Diamonds, for instance.
There are things that are impossible for me to explain.
But I want to.
I Steven, I Connie hates me! What? We weren't listening.
Also continue, Steven.
I'm not upset about what happened on Homeworld although, yeah, a lot of that
was really messed up.
But my relationship with Connie is even more messed up.
I left her behind to go to Homeworld after promising we'd face everything
together.
I'm sure I really hurt her.
I've been calling and texting her for a week, but she hasn't responded once.
Connie might never talk to me again.
[Crying.]
Steven! I'll go get him.
I don't know anything about Homeworld, but I know about this.
Steven? Steven? Steven's not here.
Oh, that's too bad.
So I guess I'll just talk to this Steven-shaped barrel instead.
If you must.
Schtuball, if this was about Connie, why didn't you say anything sooner? I was
embarra You were embroidered, embroiled, emboldened to talk to your old man
about your problems? I was embarrassed, okay? You and the Gems all liked
Connie, and I was worried that if you heard what happened that you'd be mad at
me too.
Oh, Steven, of course we're not mad.
And I'm sure Connie's not mad, either.
Well, at least I'm sure she doesn't hate you.
That whole handing-yourself over-to-Homeworld thing was definitely a high-
stress situation.
It really scared all of us.
I'm not exactly over it either, but I guess carting you off to the middle of
nowhere to spend time with you is my way of dealing with it.
Maybe having some distance from you is Connie's way.
But the last thing I did was send her a bunch of dumb texts.
I made some weird joke about tennis, and I don't even know if it makes sense.
- Tennis? - See? No wonder she hasn't responded.
Uh, Steven, you don't get any service out here.
Whaaaat are you even telling me? Maybe she's been trying to get in touch with
me this whole time, and I haven't seen it! [Gasps.]
What if she thinks I'm ignoring her? Dad! We have to find cell service.
Right.
- Go, go, go! - Okay.
Floor it! - How we doing? - Take a right.
Nah, back up.
No, wait! Keep going.
- We're heading for a cliff, buddy.
- Just a little further.
- Gonna have to stop soon.
- Almost got it.
Ahh! [Sighs.]
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Yes! We've got service.
[Gasps.]
Ronaldo: Steven! When I didn't hear back from you, I was sure a nefarious plot
was afoot Well? No.
No messages from Connie.
Aw.
You'll get through this, buddy.
I know it hurts now, but give it time.
I know.
I need to let it go.
- Got room for three more? - Always.
- Nice night, isn't it? - Steven: Yeah.

" Sorry, guys.
There's been a lot going on.
- Like what? Tell us! - Well, Connie is really mad at me.
No, no, no, no.
Tell us about space! - And start from the beginning.
- Uh, okay.
I was trying to protect Beach City, so I surrendered myself to Homeworld, and I
was put in a big, empty room, and I ended up on trial in front of the Diamonds!
- On trial? - What? - In front of the Diamonds? - Yeah, and You were in front
of Blue Diamond? And Yellow! But it's okay.
I escaped in a palanquin and went underground and You ran from Blue and Yellow
Diamond?! - Yes.
- Peridot, we have to leave Earth now.
[Sighing.]
Uh-oh.
[Pumpkin barking.]
Wait.
We can't leave.
- What about all our crops? - Guys? Ugh.
The vegetables will have to deal.
Okay.
Okay, but, uh we're only halfway through our rewatch of "CPH" season four.
[Chuckles.]
We'll bring the box set with us.
But how are we going to watch it without the TV? We'll bring the TV.
- Uh, Lapis? - Huh? - Peridot? - Oh, Steven.
Good.
Let's go.
- Wait.
What? - We'll find some remote spot in the universe to hide out in.
The Diamonds will never find us.
Lapis, don't worry.
They're looking for me on Homeworld.
They don't know I'm here.
We're safe.
Yeah.
Come on.
We've gotten away with worse.
They've never been able to hunt me down - for my many crimes against them.
- This is different.
Steven is important, and our transgressions are piling up! They're going to
take their anger out on this planet, just like they did before.
I can't.
I won't let myself get caught up in another war.
[Whimpers.]
I don't want you to leave, but I won't ask you guys to stay if you don't feel
safe.
If you have to go, I understand.
Right.
Peridot, if you want the TV, levitate it over here.
Hey, um, what about our meep morps we've made? We can't leave them behind.
We can bring them, too.
But they're installations! They need the context of the barn! If if we move
them, they'll become performance pieces.
There's no need to get so emotional! You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Performance art isn't bad, just misunderstood.
Hmm, maybe I can do something.
Ah! Our smaller-than-average lake! Guh! [Pumpkin barking.]
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
[Rumbling.]
There.
Now we can bring our whole life with us you, me, and all of our things.
- Right.
Right! - Well, let's get going.
You're leaving right now? I thought that I I don't know what to say.
Goodbye, Steven.
Good luck.
[Sniffles.]
Peridot, don't you want to say bye? Uhh [Whimpers.]
Umm [Gasps.]
Wait.
Where's Pumpkin? - She's not inside? - She was just standing next to me! We
have to find her.
I'll check from above.
Peridot, you search the ground.
- I'll help, too! Pumpkin? - Pumpkin?! Pumpkin? Pumpkin! - Pumpkin? Pumpkin! -
Pumpkin? - Pumpkin? - Pumpkin? [Softly.]
Pumpkin.
Pumpkin! Where are you, buddy? [Panting.]
Pumpkin! [Music.]
You know, I'm really going to miss you guys when you're in space.
Well, that's a given.
I'm a very precious Gem.
Without me, you would have crumbled under The Cluster's obstructive force or
have been smushed by Jasper.
I'm Peridot, there! Pumpkin! Ngh! Is she okay? Um Pumpkin! Pumpkin! Pumpkin!
Pumpkin! You know, I can probably still help you when I'm out in space.
I'll just video chat from my tablet.
Uh, t-there's no Wi-Fi in space.
Well, maybe it's best if we can't reach you.
If the Diamonds do show up and destroy the planet, we'll never know! Lapis was
very agitated when she heard you were on Homeworld.
I was bending over backwards to make her feel better.
Watch this.
[Grunting.]
[Laughs.]
That is good.
Oh, yeah.
She loves this.
[Groans.]
Maybe it's good that we'll be away from everything where nothing can change, no
surprises or developments.
She's been through so much.
- She needs consistency.
- But what about you? [Gasps.]
Another kindergartner! Fresh produce? Pumpkin is fresh produce! [Both panting.]
It's just onions? Pumpkin would never associate with this inferior sphere.
- Aah! - Aah! Uh, Onion? What are you Hey, is that my hat? Well, that was a
bust.
- We'll never find Pumpkin.
- Peridot [Rustling.]
Pumpkin? [Whimpers.]
Have you been here the whole time?! - She was hiding? - Come on, Pumpkin.
We need to leave.
[Whimpers.]
Pumpkin! Don't you walk away while I'm talking to you.
[Whimpers, barking.]
[Grunting.]
Sometimes, you have to do things you don't want to do, like get jettisoned into
space to live forever on a floating rock with a barn, and just us for as long
as time exists! Lapis needs us! Peridot, give her a second.
She's doing it to herself! Pumpkin, do as you're told! Aah! [Whimpers.]
Whoa, Peridot.
It sounds like you don't really want to go.
I'm sorry, Pumpkin.
I didn't mean to yank you around.
It's just we don't have a choice in this.
What do you mean, you don't have a choice? Peridot, you should really talk to
Lapis about this.
- I can't.
- What? Why not? Oh, great.
You found her! Now, let's go.
[Rumbling.]
[Music.]
[Shivering.]
[Shivering.]
[Shivers.]
Wait Lapis? Pumpkin doesn't want to go.
Pumpkin doesn't know better.
We do.
Actually, I I don't want to go either.
What?! - Aah! - Aah! Ooh-whoa! [Yelps.]
Peridot, what are you trying to say? It's just, if something happens on Earth,
- I want to be here for it! - But no! Why are you telling me this now?! Because
we're about to leave! - Isn't that the worst time? - Yes.
[Chuckles nervously.]
Then why didn't you tell me sooner? Well, there are many things I should say,
but they would upset you, so in general, I don't say those things.
Peridot, that's lying! [Groaning.]
Okay, then! The truth is I think that we should stay, and if and if the time
comes, if the Diamonds do come to wipe this planet off the star maps, I think
we should fight for this life we've built instead of tearing it up out of the
ground! I think we can win.
I think you can win.
Earth is our home now.
Isn't it worth fighting for? What do you say, Lapis? [Music.]
I am not getting caught in the middle of another war.
[Rumbling.]
Wait! No! You're supposed to reward me for my emotional honesty! [Sighs.]
[Insects chirping.]
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.
You're all set up, and you can stay here as long as you need.
Wow.
[Groans.]
Thanks.
[Sighs.]
What do we do now?

Kindergarten
****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e08 Episode Script ******
**** Back to the Kindergarten ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # [Alarm beeping.]
[Music.]
[Barking.]
Ooh.
Hey there, girl.
Yo, Steven! This a bad time? Of the three things I have to do in the sink now,
this is the one I least mind you seeing.
Ugh, Peridot is still depressed all up in your B-room? Yeah.
She still hasn't gotten over Lapis leaving and taking the barn with her into
space.
I think she just needs a little more time to herself.
Nope, that's it, we're getting her out.
Wait, Amethyst! Uh, Peridot? [Country music playing.]
You feeling any better? Uugghhh.
[Music stops.]
So, what have you been up to? [Mumbling.]
I, uh, couldn't really hear you there.
[Groans.]
Nothing.
You've been in this bathroom kind of a long time.
Maybe you should get some fresh air.
What's the point? - To feel better? - Come on, Peridot! I can't stand seeing
you like this.
- Like what? - Dude, let's just get out of the house.
We could go check out my old kindergarten! We met all those other Amethysts up
in space, and they all came out of the same rock as me.
I've been meaning to get a look at the old neighborhood now that I've met the
neighbors.
That sounds fun.
What do you say, Peridot? you can make us feel dumb by telling us all the stuff
we don't know! I miss that.
Great, it's settled! Let's get out of the bathroom.
- Can I bring my music? [Whimpers.]
- No.
[Music.]
Ugh.
Why exactly are we taking this outdated, clackity ship there? The prime
kindergarten has a very convenient warp pad.
Eh, we're taking the scenic route! Come on, Peridot! Take a look at the
beautiful countryside.
No.
Your efforts to entrance me with Earth's beauty are pointless.
My sector of countryside was perfect.
Now it's somewhere in space.
Just let me know when we get there.
Good ol' kindergarten! Just the way I left it! Aw, some things never change!
Gah, actually, everything's different now! Man, I-I used to think this place
was full of empty holes, but now it's like it's empty with holes which were
once full! All those Amethysts I met in space they were all here! While I was
right there in the ground.
But now I can finally start putting some faces to holes! Hohohoh, let's see
Hup! This must've been 8XJ! Ooh! 8XK! 8XL! Peridot: Actually, the order goes
from top to bottom.
- That's 8XJ.
- Really? Yes.
Curly hair, right? Yeah! How'd you know? You can tell from the iron deposits in
the formation there.
And that's 8XL down below.
Whoa, that's pretty amazing, Dot.
This used to make sense to me.
I thought life was generated in a kindergarten.
Formless, aimless energy channeled into new, useful gems.
But life doesn't start in a kindergarten.
It ends here.
I've gotten used to plants everywhere.
Bugs and breeze and sunshine all of that has been sucked out of this place.
It's with the Amethysts that were produced here, and now this place is nothing
but a miserable husk.
All of the Amethysts are gone.
Hey! Oh, all the well-made Amethysts are gone.
Yo, not better.
And nothing will ever grow here again, not even this flower.
Wait! Oh! I've never seen anything growing here, and I've been hanging around
this joint for 5,000 years.
Man, it looks healthy, too.
Wow! That's Earth for you - always bouncing back.
- I don't know.
I'd have to run some tests to see if this is not an anomaly.
You want to try planting stuff here? You know how to farm! Yeah, that could be
fun! It could be an interesting experiment.
Yeah! Let's re-garden the kindergarten! [Zing!.]
[Music.]
[Gulls crying.]
[Alarm beeping.]
[Music.]
Peridot: They don't need any more water after yesterday, - but according to -
Ahh.
several tutorials I read, the roots should be starting to take hold.
Oh, yeah? So that's something we can check for today, as soon as Steven! What
are you doing in that bathing gown?! Get dressed already! Oh, uh, right.
[Train whistle blows.]
Do you think they grew much overnight? Yeah, I bet the place looks even better!
We should plant even more stuff.
What do you think we should do next? - What about hydrangeas? - Uh, which one's
that? I don't know, but it sounds good, right? What do you think, Peridot? Hey,
thanks for doing this with me.
- What? [Chuckles.]
Come on.
- It was fun.
I'm just glad I was able to fix something.
Yeah, the kindergarten looks better than ever! [Wind whistling.]
Well, I don't know why I'm surprised.
I should've known not to have hope.
But maybe if we try again It's not going to work! It's never going to work,
okay?! Hey, don't be a jerk! We were just trying to cheer you up.
And good job with that! I feel just great now that I know that nothing's ever
going to get better! Everything is just ruined forever! We can't get any of it
back! Not my home! Not Lapis! And not this crummy planet, either! We might as
well just throw it all in the garbage and toss ourselves in after, because it's
all just hopeless trash! Peridot, maybe the sunflowers didn't work, but we know
something can grow here.
This clod's just like us! Too dumb to get with the program! [Squish!.]
[Whimpers.]
[Rumbling.]
Uhhh.
- Uh? - Waaaa! [Crack!.]
[Roars.]
Oh, of course! [Roars.]
Peridot! [Roars.]
Whoa! [Panting.]
- Want to get this together? - Let's do it! [Music.]
[Roaring.]
I need to go to the bathroom.
Man, you were right.
The kindergarten really is dead forever.
I was a fool to think we could reinstitute life there.
[Sighs.]
Tell me about it.
All right.
I will.
I was pretty much using this as a distraction from losing Lapis, losing the
barn, and just a general sense of complete hopelessness I tend to deal with on
a day-to-day basis.
But it really only confirmed for me that once you mess something up, it's
ruined for good and nothing will ever be able to grow again.
Yeah, we got the subtext.
Oh, wow.
What about all this? Now that's some plants.
Huh.
Guess the countryside out here is pretty beautiful.
But who cares? I wanted to have this for the kindergarten! Even if there was
nothing we can do for that one patch of land, there's still a whole Earth
blooming all around us.
Yeah! Why don't we try gardening in literally any other place? It'll be easier
than trying to plant in the kindergarten.
That dirt doesn't care how green your thumb is.
Green thumb! 'Cause you're green.
[Laughs.]
- I know that! - So, are ya in? - Um - Do it, do it, do it, say yes! Ugh.
Fine.
I've got literally nothing else to do.
- Oh, yeah! - Yay! [Music.]

by f1nc0 [Seagulls squawking.]
[Door chimes.]
Thanks for coming.
- Hey, Sadie! - Hey, Steven.
What'll it be? Sorry to be a pain, but I got kind of a long order.
I hope it's not too much trouble.
What trouble? [Chuckles.]
I'm a professional doughnut girl.
Okay I'll have one jelly doughnut with powdered sugar on the side, three
chocolate frosted, one frosted chocolate, two chocolate-frosted chocolate, one
dog-nut medium well one coffee with milk and sugar, hold the coffee.
I also have several methods of payment I'd like you to split this order across
evenly.
- Uh, what's all this for? - Band practice.
- You're in a band?! - Kinda.
I started jamming with Jenny, Buck, and Sour Cream! Whoa! That's so cool! Aw,
man! I bet you guys sound amazing! We're still trying to figure out our sound,
but it's been fun just playing music with other people.
It's also nice to have an outlet that doesn't involve space and gem stuff and
everything else going on.
Um You doing okay? Well, I worry about Lars being in space, and I hope he's
safe and all but [Sighs.]
Working all these shifts by myself has been a huge drag.
I'm totally used to doing his work, but I'm used to at least having him here to
talk to.
Now I got to do that myself, too.
Oh, come on, Sadie, you missed a spot! Oh, no, sorry.
Well, we'll all be practicing at Sour Cream's place tonight.
- Feel free to stop by if you have time.
- I'll try! Hopefully I can finish restocking napkins early.
We're always running out, for some reason.
Hmm, weird.
Well, see ya, Sadie! Bye, Steven.
[Electronic beats playing.]
What do ya call that style? - Beach core.
- Buck: Hey.
- What's up, Buck? - Guess who's got a gig at Delmarva's number-two music and
seafood festival this weekend?! Chuji and the Woo Woos? - Jack and the Frosted
Tips? - 7-Force? No, us! All: What?! - We don't even have a name yet! - Or a
set list! Or even one single song to put on a set list! [Sighs.]
Guess we got a lot of work to do.
What if we went for a more of a rap-a-billy style? - No, thanks.
- How about something like Here we are Our hearts combining Music and friends,
our souls aligning Buck: Hold on, Steven.
You got a really cool sentiment going on that can resonate with a wide
audience.
I just feel like this seafood festival needs to hear something challenging and
provocative.
Check this out.
[Guitar strumming.]
Doo-doo Butt The government - # Corrupts # - Jenny: Hold on there, Bucky D.
I'm all for being socially conscious and waking people up inside, but people
are gonna be at this seafood fest to have fun! Let's give them something they
can dance to! - Sour Cream, give me a beat! - A what? A beat! [Echoing.]
# Beat # Oh, yeah! Let's spice it up! [Funky riff plays.]
Cool! Yeah! And then how about some [Screeching tones play.]
- What the heck, Sour Cream?! - What? Can't let your audience get too
comfortable.
Maybe we should just call it a night and try again tomorrow.
- Agreed.
- Sadie: Oh, hey, guys! Sorry I'm so late.
Took longer to close up than I thought it would.
- Y'all still practicing? - Oh, sorry, Sadie, we just wrapped up.
- We were getting nowhere.
- Aw, shoot! I really wanted to hear you guys.
Well, let me know if you have another band practice when I'm not working.
- See ya, guys.
- Bye, Sadie! - Later.
- Bye, Sadie.
See ya, girl.
[Dog barking in distance.]
[Sprinkler whirring.]
- Steven: Hi, Sadie! - S'up? - Hey, how's it goin'? - Hey, girl.
Whoa! Hey, guys! I just got home from work.
[Chuckles.]
We know.
We followed you.
Sorry if that's weird.
We know how busy your schedule is, so we decided to bring the jam to you.
Aw, shucks, guys! But [Groans nervously.]
My room is such a mess right now.
Okay, ah, okay, just give me a moment to tidy up! Dang, Sadie! You've got so
much space in here! Yo, Sadie, do you have any free outlets to plug into? - Oh,
yeah, check over by the TV.
- Let's get serious now.
- The show is this weekend! - Wait I can't really feel the music in this
cramped spot.
- This looks comfy.
- No, wait! [Crunch.]
Aw, doo-doo.
I think I broke your bed.
[Grunts.]
Sour Cream: Whoa! Scary movies! Hey, Sadie, you've got a dark side.
It's more of a dork side.
Jenny: Hey, is that "The Lurch"? - You know this one? - Yeah! It's a classic! I
can't believe you have a copy! Guys, we have to watch this.
Brains! [Groaning.]
[Screams.]
I can't believe you like this one.
Not everyone appreciates Bulgarian horror.
Uh, guys, don't we need to find our sound? I kind of like this sound.
[Eerie music playing.]
[Dark electronic beat plays.]
Ooh.
I like that.
[Bass playing.]
And then, we can do this.
[Guitar strumming.]
Now we just need some provocative lyrics.
Tired - # From work # - Nice.
[Chuckles.]
Hate My job [Guitar playing.]
I really oughta be in mourning But I've got another shift this morning Everyday
feels like it's never-ending What's the point of all this time I'm spending
Here At this Dead-end job Oh We are the working dead And we lurch for minimum
wage But I'd really rather be Eating your brain Look at you you seem so bright
and healthy And your minds are full of joy and wonder Stay a thousand miles
from the condition That I've got from all the stress I'm under Don't come near
me or you might encourage All these terrifying sudden urges Seeing you makes
skipping work so tempting Don't you know that in the night, I'm temping Here At
this Dead-end job Oh We are the working dead And we lurch for minimum wage But
I'd really rather be Eating your brain [Woman screaming.]
- Whoa! - Whoa! - Sadie, that was awesome! - Yeah, girl, yeah! That was so rad!
You're not Sadie Miller, you're Sadie Killer.
This is it! This is our sound! Sadie, you should be our frontman! Really?!
[Chuckling.]
Wow, I Uh, wait, no, I can't.
Ugh, I've got to work tomorrow.
Actually, you guys should probably pack up.
I got to get some rest before my shift.
Aw, doo-doo.
[Seagulls squawking.]
[Door chimes.]
Hey.
What're you doing here? I was just wondering if I could get some advice.
We've been trying to write some more spooky songs without you, but they sound
so phony coming from me.
Rawr, I'm a bad, bad boy! Yeesh.
I don't know.
I can't do it like you.
You got any tips? Let's see.
First, lose your youth to your boring job.
Then lose the only person you've ever felt truly close to.
And then lose your mind working all his shifts.
I don't think I can do all that before the show tomorrow.
[Chuckles nervously.]
Are you sure you can't come? I'm the only employee at the shop.
I can't just leave.
Singing is fun, and being in the band would be really fun like the most fun
ever.
B-But a lot of things could be a lot of things.
This job is a drag, but at last I know it's a drag.
It's normal.
There's something nice about that, you know? Hanging out, singing and stuff, it
feels so not normal.
It's like you ever feel so bad that you feel good? Like when you get so cold
that it burns.
Sometimes I just want to scream my guts out.
Well, no not my guts, but whatever thing is squirming around in my guts.
Wow! That That's poetry! You're such a natural at this.
All right, I'll try my best.
How's this? Hate my job, hate my job Obligations No vacations Kinda sa-a-a-d Do
I really sound like that? No, no, y-you sing it like it's really a problem for
you.
Don't worry, I'll get it, I promise.
Squirming in my guts I got to sell doughnuts Big doughnut [Humming.]
[Insects chirping.]
I can't believe your car can hold all these amps.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, it's Steven Universe.
Is that the scariest jacket you could find? Mm-hmm.
Hope it doesn't scare anyone too much.
- So no Sadie Killer, huh? - 'Fraid not.
She's just - too busy with work.
- Aw, man! This gig won't be the same without her.
All right, Steven, you're gonna have to up your scary game to fill Sadie's
shoes.
Got it! Rawr! You can't help being cute, no more than I can help being cool.
Let's go.
[Engine starts.]
Okay.
Jenny: Buckle up, y'all.
Hope the seafood at this thing is good.
So where is this place exactly? Buck: I gave you the directions.
Oh, that tiny piece of paper? Where'd I put it? - Did it fall under the seat? -
I don't see it back here.
Yo, what if this was all a dream? - [Groans.]
This is not - Sadie: Hey! Wait up! [Panting.]
- Sadie! - Sadie! [Panting.]
I can do it! I can do the show! I can come! - All right! Yeah! - Oh, thank
goodness! And I can come to practice, and I can come to the next show and the
show after that! But, Sadie, don't you have work? Ha! I quit! sync & corr.

**** Kevin Party ****
If you see him, call me right away.
He's my only inter-dimensional gateway to space, and I love him.
Okay, I think I have enough fliers left to Aah! Aah! [Tires screech.]
[Music.]
What are you doing Saturday night? - Hey! Listen! Little kid! - Beat it, Kevin.
I'm throwing a party at my parents' palatial estate.
All the coolest teens in Delmarva have RSVP'd except one the only one cooler
than I am.
Are you talking about me? What? No! Ew! - I'm talking about Stevonnie.
- W-What?! You can't just [Grumbles.]
This is the last thing I need right now.
Look, Stevonnie is better than me, okay? Better dancer, better driver.
Stevonnie truly does not care what anyone thinks.
That's why they're the coolest.
If I can't be the coolest, I at least got to be seen hanging with the coolest.
Stevonnie only exists when Connie and I are together, and we're I'm not coming.
[Sighs.]
Great.
So I invited that other kid for nothing.
Wh Connie's going?! [Panting.]
Of course she's going.
No one turns down an invitation to a Kevin party.
But she can't stand you.
Why would she [Gasps.]
Wait.
Did you say all of this to her, too? Does she think I'm [Grunts.]
I'm gonna be there? [Engine revs.]
- Is it too late to RSVP? - Yes.
But I'll make an exception for Stevonnie.
[Tires squeal.]
[Tires screech.]
Wait.
What's your number? I'll text you the address.
Oh.
Yeah, uh, 301-555 Here, you enter it.
Okay, uh, how do I? You roll the little ball to navigate.
The screen is so tiny.
Here.
Huh, your name's Steven? Weird.
I thought it was Clarence.
See you at the party Saturday, Steven.
[Tires squeal.]
[Indistinct conversations.]
[Mid-tempo music playing.]
Steven! What took you so long?! I-I got lost coming up the driveway.
Derrick: Yo, Kev, who invited the 7-year-old, bro? Hey, shut your mouth,
Derrick! I thought I told you to go buy more ice! Ugh.
You just come from picture day at school or something? I brought snacks? Wha?
Aah! This party is lame enough as it is.
Look at these people.
[Music.]
This is forgettable.
But not for long.
Every time Stevonnie shows up on the scene, everybody's talking about it.
And when Stevonnie shows up at my party, everyone's gonna be talking about this
night until they're old grandparents, and their last words to their
grandchildren will be, "Kevin throws the best parties.
" [Chuckles nervously.]
Um [Camera shutter clicks.]
Lion?! Wait, you're the one who had him the whole time?! What? Ugh! No, I'm
allergic to dogs.
Then what's he doing here? [Gasps.]
[Music.]
- Connie! - Hey! I haven't seen her in so long.
She looks so different.
Ugh! I thought she'd be here to see me, but maybe she's just here to have a
good time.
Maybe she's moved on.
She's moved on? Wait, did you guys break up? Can 7-year-olds even do that? I'm
14.
You didn't tell me you guys broke up.
You got a free ticket to what would have been the best teen party in Delmarva.
But now it's just some sad kid party getting crashed by a couple of sad kids!
All right, okay.
I'm I'm leaving.
[Inhales.]
No.
When did this happen? A few weeks ago.
Hmm.
You been texting her? Several dozen times.
[Sighs.]
She text you back? Um, no.
Hmm, but she knew you'd be here.
Right! Right.
I'll I'll just go talk to her.
[Voice breaking.]
I'll I'll just go tell her how sorry I am.
I-I really messed up.
[Sniffles.]
I-I was an idiot! And I Whoa! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, kid, listen.
I wouldn't normally do this because you're a pitiful kid with snot coming out
of your nose [Sobs, sniffles.]
but I need those old people to whisper my name when they die.
And if you don't pull it together, you're gonna regret it.
And it'll be Sabina all over again! Wh Who's [sniffles.]
Who's Sabina? [Music.]
You can't just dump your emotional honesty face all over her.
You're gonna freak her out.
[Sniffles.]
I-I just want us to talk again.
Exactly.
But look what she's doing.
Life is good.
She's got a dog now.
[Sighs.]
And a haircut.
Right.
But your life is good, too.
You don't need to talk to her, either.
You've got new stuff going on new friends, new shirt.
She gave this to me for my birthday.
Ugh.
Derrick! Gimme your jacket.
Derrick: What? No.
Dude! Aah! - Derrick! Give me the - Come on! Here.
Put this on.
Your friend looks kind of mad, though.
He's not my friend.
Put it on.
Collar up.
Hmm, not quite cool enough.
I got it.
Nice.
It's almost like you have style.
Why do I need the scarf? It's not even cold out.
When you put on a scarf like this, it's always cool.
Let's show her what a great time you're having.
[Music.]
Hey, kid, you should say hi to Connie.
So I can tell her about my feelings? No.
Be casual.
You're showing her how you have it together.
You're not dying to talk to her because you're not dying at all.
You're living.
Make her want that life with you.
Kevin, that that's kind of moving.
So move already.
Walk over, be cool, and walk away.
Got it.
Okay.
Be cool.
Be cool, yeah.
Be cool.
- Hey! - Hi.
[Coughs.]
Nice weather you're wearing.
- Uh, I got your texts.
- Oh, yeah.
I forgot about those because I've been living.
Wha? Well, back to my great life.
Uh, chowzers.
[Whimpers.]
That was terrible! This is all wrong, Kevin! No way.
Look, little man.
Your girl's making her way back for more.
Steven! What is going on?! I came here hoping we could talk, but it seems like
you only want to talk to Kevin.
I guess Kevin is your best friend now.
- What? No, no, no! - What? No, no, no! [Sighs.]
Anyway, I'm glad you're doing well.
That's all I really wanted to know.
No, no! But But you're my best friend! Best friend?! What are you kids even
talking about? I thought she was your ex.
Great.
Now what am I gonna do? Think, Kevin.
How do people treat their friends? Connie! Wait, wait, Connie.
Don't go.
Steven, I wasn't trying to ignore you.
I was going to text you back.
I-I wrote, "I can't talk to you right now," but then I realized if I sent it,
that would be talking to you.
And it didn't make any sense.
I wasn't making any sense.
If we were going to talk, I thought it's got to be in person.
So I rode Lion to your house, but there was a note that said, "Gone
vacationing," and then I ran into Kevin and he said you'd be here, but, uh,
maybe this is still too soon.
I-I don't even know what to say to you.
I'm angry.
I miss you.
I feel like I'm out of my mind.
No, you're not.
I surrendered myself to Homeworld.
I let them take me away, maybe forever, and then I came back and I tried to act
like it was no big deal.
But it was a big deal.
I couldn't stand the thought of you being taken away on that spaceship, but
then I did that to you.
I promised you we'd always be a team, and I let you down.
I'm sorry.
Jam buds? Jam buds.
It's so good to talk to you.
I've been wanting to see you so bad I accepted a party invitation from Kevin.
[Chuckles.]
I know.
I took his advice.
[Chuckles.]
I think he got is heart broken.
I-It's actually really sad.
[Chuckles.]
Of course he did.
- [Chuckles.]
Hey, nice shirt.
- Nice hair.
[Chuckles.]
Thank you.
All right! Hey, everybody, are you having fun? Together: Yeah! Liars! You're
all so fake.
You make me sick.
But get ready.
I'm gonna introduce you to somebody so real you'll all feel as sick as me! This
party starts now! Children! Go! [Music.]
It's pretty late.
We should head out.
Thanks for all your help, Kevin.
What? [Microphone thuds.]
You got to do the thing.
What did I help you for if you're not gonna elevate my party? Wha? Hey! Don't
you walk away from [Water splashes.]
[Gasping.]
[Derrick laughs.]
Shut up, Derrick! If it helps, Kevin, I think you threw a very nice party.
Mm-hmm.
Good night! [Roars.]
No! Wait! [Partygoers cheering.]
[Groans.]
[Pop!.]

****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e11 Episode Script ******
**** Lars of the Stars ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # - Steven, come on! -
Sorry.
I just had to make sure I had everything.
I bet Lars will really appreciate this package his parents put together for
him.
And MC Bear Bear! To hug if he gets scared.
I'm so excited we're finally going to have a space adventure together.
Steven and Connie in space! I'm not so sure this is gonna be an adventure.
Last time I saw Lars, he was huddled up in a dark cave with some other
Homeworld fugitives.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, I'm ready for anything.
Lion.
You ready? [Groans.]
- Eee! - Oh, my gah.
- We have to stay on task.
- Mm.
[Grumbles.]
[music.]
- Aah! - Waah! - Steven.
- Lars? It's over! I've got you now, you miserable off colors! You'll never
take us alive, Emerald! W-What is going on? Captain, I'm having a vision.
We're about to be discovered by Emerald! - W-Wait.
Captain?! - W-Wait.
Captain?! Thanks, Padparadscha.
Fluorite, how are the engines looking? Le-e-t me-e-e che-e-e-ck.
Twins, fire up the nova thrusters.
- Yes, captain.
- Right away, captain.
No! No! Those are my nova thrusters! That is my ship! Rhodonite, everything
clear up ahead? For now.
It was a minor inconvenience when you stole my personal shuttle and crashed it
on Upsilon 9.
It was an insult when you impersonated imperial officers during a cosmic
jubilee.
[Both laughing.]
But to steal my Sun Incinerator is unacceptable! If this ship means so much to
you, maybe you shouldn't have left it unguarded in the docking bay of Klavius
7.
There were 67 elite Citrines guarding it! Oh.
I didn't see them.
No, wait.
I did.
They didn't see us.
Oh, I'll get you! I'll get you myself! I'll do it right now.
[Chuckling.]
I'll blow you up to smithereens! Good luck catching us.
We stole your fastest ship! The engines are a-a-all se-e-t.
Twins, hyperspeed us out of here.
- Right.
- Right.
You will not go at hyperspeed! - Bingo, bongo.
- Off colors! Man, she's been on my tail since sector four.
That's like three sectors ago.
Get over it, right? Lars! I have so many questions! Uh, where'd you get this
ship? And more importantly, where'd you get that cape? [Chuckles.]
Stole 'em.
Ste-e-e-ven.
Is tha-a-tanother human frie-e-nd? Yeah, I'm Connie.
Happy to be aboard.
You must all be Lars' crew.
[Chuckles.]
They're more than that.
Without them, I'd still be stuck in a cave on the Gem Homeworld.
They were able to figure out a way off that lame old planet.
But we never would have been able to steal a ship without Lars.
He can slip past all the scanners undetected.
Her name is Connie.
And now a few stolen ships and a couple of space crimes later, we're finally on
a course toward Earth.
Hey, you know, speaking of Earth, your parents put this together for you.
Oh! Oh, finally! Clean jeans! Oh, man! And my skull gauges! These are perfect!
[Sighs.]
They'd didn't have to do all this.
I'll be back on Earth soon.
We are excited about your Beach City.
I look forward to a planet of sand and water.
Yeah! And my house.
And my trampoline.
The Big Donut! And Sadie.
How is Sadie? Oh, really, really good! Oh.
Yeah? Now she's Sadie Killer and the Suspects.
Her band is awesome.
She looks really happy without me.
[Alarm blaring.]
What's going on? Lars? Lars! Lars! Captain Lars, a huge battleship is
approaching fast.
It'll be here in just five quads.
What are your orders? I don't believe this.
[Inhales.]
How is she having such a good time without me?! Does she even know I died out
here?! Of course she does! She's been worried sick! Already three quads away.
What should we do? We could drop out of warp and ambush them, but that might be
too risky.
Or maybe we find a nearby planet to hide on? I'm not sure! What do you usually
do? Usually? Usually we just follow Captain Lars' orders! Captain Lars has
taken so many risks on our behalf.
We need him! Oh, no! The warning alarm! We're in danger! Do you hear that? Your
crew needs you.
You don't get it, do you, Steven? [Sniffles.]
It should be me.
[Crying.]
I'm the one that should be hanging out with the cool kids! She's getting back
at me for everything I've done! Do you really think Sadie is living her life
just to get back at you? Why else would she be having so much fun without me?!
Because life goes on, no matter what happens.
She was so upset when she found out you'd be stuck in space, Lars.
She really misses you, but she can't stay sad forever.
She started hanging out with the cool kids.
She quit the Big Donut all because she needed to do something to feel better.
And look at you! Steven said you'd be hiding in some cave on Homeworld, but
you're not.
You're out here fighting for freedom with all your new friends in tow! Are you
doing any of this to hurt Sadie? No! I'm doing this because I have to.
I'd never do this to hurt Sadie because - Because! - Because! - Because you're
best friends! - Because you're best friends! And best friends wouldn't do
anything to hurt each other.
Whoa.
It's here.
An imperial warship has just caught up to us.
- What? - An imperial warship? The Destiny Destroyer! Their main weapons are
pointed right at us! Hmm, pulling out the big guns just for us, huh? With a
ship like that, Emerald could wipe us out in an instant, if she really wanted
to.
Of course she wants to! Incoming message from the Destiny Destroyer.
Onscreen.
[Laughs.]
Did you really think I wasn't going to be able to track my own ship? The Sun
Incinerator's specialized nova thrusters give off an energy signature I could
recognize from the other side of the galaxy.
Now surrender to me or be destroyed! [Laughs.]
I'd never surrender to you! Blow us into stardust like you've always dreamed
of.
Very well.
Prepare yourselves for destruction! Lars, what are you doing?! Drop the
shields, Rhodonite.
But that would leave us open to their attack! We wouldn't stand a chance! Trust
me, we'll be just fine.
- Now lower the shields.
- But The destroyer's weapons are charged at 90%.
They're preparing to open fire! Lower the shields! That's an order! [Gulps.]
L-Lowering shields.
[All screaming.]
Twins, what's our status? Our weapons and shields have been knocked offline,
but Otherwise, we're fine.
We're stillalive! The lasers barely grazed us! Emerald is about to attack, but
she's going to miss on purpose.
[Chuckles.]
Bingo, bongo! What do you think you're doing?! [Laughing.]
You really do have a heart, don't you, Emerald? W-What?! You're not going to
hurt this ship! You love this ship! it's your best friend.
You'd much rather let it get away than destroy it.
[Giggles.]
Wow, Lars, I missed you.
You're right about that.
I won't destroy my beautiful ship.
But I will make it so you can't get away! Aim for their nova thrusters! [All
shouting.]
Evasive maneuvers! If only our weapons and shields were online.
I think she has us this time.
Unless we use that.
That?! No-o-o-t tha-a-a-a-t.
- What's that? - The captain's experimental fighter jet that only he knows how
to drive.
It's too risky! We're out of options.
But, Lars, your crew needs you here on the ship.
You got a better idea? Captain Lars, permission to go in your place.
If it's anything like driving a car, I should be fine.
Permissiongranted! Take out the enemy's main cannons while we get our weapons
system and shields back online.
Fluorite, how long before we have full power to shields and weapons? Give me
fi-i-ve minu-u-tes.
Can they really fly it? If anyone can fly it, I'm sure it's friends of our
captain.
[Grunts.]
Whoa! It is like a car! We'll watch your back while you take out those guns.
Now launch! Captain Lars is about to give the order to launch.
Okay.
Launching.
Get in close! They can't aim at themselves.
Roger.
Target within range.
Targeting! One down! That's two! Yes! All right! Everything's almost fixed
here.
Come on back.
Incoming missiles straight ahead! It's too late, Lars.
I can't [Screams.]
Steven?! Connie?! Nooooo!

[Ship whooshes, alarms blaring.]
[Grunting.]
Aaghh! That did it! Emerald is on the run! Lars! We're hit! Nothing's working!
Wha? Hold on Wh-what is your course? We'll try and intercept [Computer
warbles.]
Lars?! What is wrong with you, ship?! [Beeping.]

Pretty much everything.
Well at least the display works! [Electricity crackles.]
Aah! [Screams.]

[Heavy thudding.]

[Gasps.]
Okay.

I'm fine.
I'll find the ship's radio and Lars'll pick us right up.
Whoa.

[Computerized whirring.]
The cockpit! [Exhales.]
Hello? This is Star Skipper calling Sun Incinerator! It's Stevonnie! Steven and
Connie? We're stranded! We need help! Come on! Don't leave me here! [Radio
crackles, whirring fades.]
What do we do now? That was our best chance We can't fix the radio.
The ship's beyond hope no one knows where we are! [Groans.]
What do we do?! [Creature shrieks.]
[Leaves rustle.]
[Creature roars.]
[Grunts.]
[Growls, shrieks.]
An alien! [Shrieks.]
Aah! [Gasps.]
[Music.]
[Shrieks.]
[Leaves rustle.]
Uh, glad they're okay! Wait.
If life can thrive here then so can I.
I've just gotta hold out till Lars finds me.
Until then we survive.
[Grunting.]
[Music.]
[Chomp!.]
Mmm.
[Inhales deeply.]
[Bubbles gurgling.]
[Laughs.]
[Straining.]
[Lightning crashes.]

[Laughs softly.]
Come on.
We have to! We're out of energy bars! But it's so cute! But we need the protein
for a healthy diet! There has to be a better way! We can just stick to fruit
fruit's good! [Roars.]
Aah! [Panting.]
[Music.]
[Roars.]
[Grunts.]
[Roars.]
[Beak snapping.]
[Snorts.]
Phew Huh Have I been here before? No, that's ridiculous.
[Roaring in the distance.]
Well, guess I'm camping here tonight.
[Fire crackling.]
Finally.
Goodnight, Stevonnie! Goodnight, Stevonnie.
Sweet dreams [Snoring.]
Mm.
Hmm? What?! I-I'm home? Dr.
Maheswaran: [Muffled.]
You were told to be prepared cycles ago.
[Rumbling.]
[Normally.]
There'll be no more excuses.
Get it done.
And don't expect me to look kindly upon this transgression.
Embark at once.
Mom? What is she talkin' about? Huh?! [Grunts.]
Yes, I know there's organic life on the surface.
It's an invasion.
Hey, mom! What are you talking about!? You will stick to my orders, and you
will destroy them! [Sighs.]
I hate it when she ignores me.
No.
[Panting.]
[Sighs.]
Mm [Grunts.]
- No.
I will not repeat myself.
- Whoa! [Grunting.]
- Hm.
- That is simply unacceptable.
[Sing-songy.]
Mom! Well, you'll have to remember, won't you.
[Huffs.]
[Grunting.]
The dullness of this exchange tires me.
Just land the drop ships and do your pathetic job for once, or I'll shatter you
and your crew myself.
Hey, mom!! What are you doing?! [Music.]
Honey, please give me a moment.
[Ship whirrs.]
Huh? [Shrieks excitedly.]
Whoa, cool! Stevonnie: Yelloooooow! Hey, Yellow! Oh, you're still here.
What are you doing? I'm commanding the dropships to colonize this planet.
I wanna command a drop ship! Well, when you have your own colony, you can
command whatever you want.
I want a colony! [Chiming.]
I want one now! What's this?! I'm contacting the leader of the fleet.
Let me do it! [Chiming.]
Aah! Whoa! Don't touch that! [Huffs.]
Why not?! You have so many worlds and I don't even have one! It's not fair! I.
Want.
One.
I want my own army! I want my own planet! I deserve it! I'm just as important
as you! Then why don't you act like it Pink? [Music.]
[Growls.]
[Gasps.]
Whoa! [Panting.]
Steven, what was that? Diamonds I'm having Diamond dreams again, but why now?
Why here? [Music.]
No way [Grunts.]
This is just like the moon base orbiting Earth.
[Grunts.]
Whoa, now That must have been a colony Wait a second [Music.]
Pink Diamond was here Oh! [Panting.]
And Yellow! [Grunting.]
That's it! I hope this thing still works! Hmm That pattern [Chiming.]
[Beeping.]
Nope.
Nuh-uh.
Ugh, yikes! [Gasps.]
It's Lars' ship! Keep searching! We're not giving up on them! No matter what!
Lars! Hey, Lars! Hey, Lars! There you are! We've been looking all over for you!
Oh, my gosh, Lars! It's so good to see you.
Set a course for their signal! It's good to see you, too.
[Sighs.]
Thanks, Lars [Thudding.]
[Muffled roar.]
Hello, bird blob, my old friend.
[Chuckles nervously.]
[Roars.]
[Glass cracking.]
Lars, hurry! We've got company! [Ship whirring.]
Yeehaw! Ugh, what the heck is that?! I don't know, but it's not here to play
nice! Charge the blasters! [Energy crackles.]
[Music.]
[Creature warbles.]
[Exhales deeply.]
[Ship whirs.]
Ha! Looks like we just saved your butts! Lets get you up here and back home
through my head.
Yeah, I think I'm ready to go home.

# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #

Star date, uh Thursday.
Space is really big.
Everything is messed up.
Our nova thrusters are busted.
And getting home is taking forever.
Hey, Captain? Should we be writing this down? Uh, yeah! [Music.]
Who wants a party sub?! What exactly are we celebrating? You guys beat Emerald.
And you rescued me and Connie from the Jungle Moon.
And you have this super fast ship, so you'll be back on Earth in no time.
It's only super fast when it works! Captain Lars I've finished rerouting Power
from the gravity engine to the nova thrusters? Great! Twins, floor it on the
thrusters! Right away, Captain.
Yes, Captain.
Aww! Aww! Aww! Aww! Captain Lars, don't use the thrusters.
We're going to lose power! Thanks, Padparadscha.
Hey, if we're going to be drifting a while, there's somebody I'd like you all
to meet.
[Groans.]
Are they bigger than that sandwich? Maybe a few pickles bigger.
Bigger than you? I mean, they don't have to be.
Fine.
Bring 'em over.
[Shing!.]
[Shing!.]
[Whoosh!.]
Twins! AnotherSteven? There's more of you?! [All gasp.]
[Music.]
Her eyes.
A fusion? He's going to bring back another Steven! This is Garnet.
She leads the Crystal Gems back on Earth.
Just look at you all! You must be Rhodonite a Ruby and a Pearl? That must have
been a story.
I want all the details.
[Chuckles nervously.]
Eh.
And you must be the Rutile Twins.
[Gasps.]
I've never seen anyone like you before.
We weremade like this.
Fluorite.
Whoa.
You're just, uh, beautiful.
And here's Padparadscha, an orange Sapphire.
How rare.
I predict you're going to make everyone uncomfortable.
It's not nice to make fun of us like that.
Haven't you guys heard a compliment before? A what? What's that? You know, it's
when someone says something nice about you.
Who would say nice things about Gems like us? We're completely inappropriate,
and so are you.
We should all be ashamed.
Aw, Steven.
These Gems feel just like I did before I met Rose Quartz.
- Both: Rose Quartz? - Rose Quartz? You met Rose Quartz? And your survived? You
guys know about Rose? She was the Anit-Gem an organic beast that burst out of
Earth's crust and vowed to destroy all Gems! No, no.
She was made from a vein of hyper-defective quartz.
A malformed quartz gone haywire.
Don'tbesilly.
RoseQuartzisn'treal.
You have it all wrong.
Rose Quartz?! Of course that's how they tell it on Homeworld.
Come on, everyone.
Let me tell you the story of the real Rose Quartz.
It was Era 1.
The Diamonds, unique in their flawlessness, sought to expand their perfection
across the galaxy.
And it was for this purpose that Pink Diamond chose her first colony, the
planet Earth.
On Earth, every Gem was made to serve Pink Diamond, each with a role to play in
her world's perfect empire.
In comparison to their creator, their existence was ordinary.
They were life-forms only meant to fit their mold, and no one had ever dared to
think otherwise until there was Rose Quartz.
In stature, she was no different than any other Quartz, and for a time, she did
her best to carry out her Diamond's bidding.
[Music.]
However, she began to take notice of her strange colony and the life that
existed there.
Curiosity turned to appreciation.
Appreciation turned to fondness.
And fondnessturned to love.
Soon she was unable to keep her findings secret, and she began asking her
fellow Gems if they knew of the life on Earth and what they made of it.
She continued to pry her fellow kindergartners with questions so odd that word
of her eventually made its way to Pink Diamond.
Rose Quartz was summoned at once.
"Quartz," began Pink Diamond, "What have you been saying down there?" "Why,
Diamond," Rose pleaded, "It has come to my attention that your colony, Earth,
bears life.
While I know these organic life-forms serve no purpose, I ask that we leave
this planet and spare their lives.
" Pink Diamond thought for a moment and then laughed, a wicked, empty sound.
"You wish to save these life-forms at the expense of our own? Ha! Don't be
absurd.
Return to your post, and I will forget your insolence.
" And with that, Rose Quartz was dragged back to her kindergarten for duty.
Only Rose could no longer stand to continue aiding in the destruction of Earth.
She had no choice.
She had to fight.
[Twinkle!.]
[Music.]
"Is this what you want to inject, to build? I've seen the life that exists for
itself, and it lives here.
Will you destroy it, or will you join it?" Rose's message began to resonate, to
Pink Diamond's dismay.
Her colony was falling apart.
So, like a coward, she called for her Diamond allies, Yellow and Blue, to help.
But Rose also found herself with allies, other Gems that were cast out for
being wrong a Pearl who belonged to no one a Bismuth who built weapons for
rebels instead of towers for tyrants an entirely new fusion for not power but
for love and countless others, all inspired by Rose to live for ourselves on
Earth.
She was our leader.
And Earth was our precious home.
And those who fought to save it became known as the Crystal Gems! Unbelievable.
There were Gems like us? Fighting.
Fortheirfreedom? Yes, and we were fearless.
It was an impossible fight, but we fought anyway.
And the more Gems who saw us, the more who joined.
But Pink Diamond's forces proved too strong.
Rose feared that soon she would have nothing left to protect.
[Music.]
Rose Quartz drew her rebel blade [Shing! Crack!.]
and shattered Pink Diamond, saving the Earth for all time from her reign of
terror.
Wow! That's incredible! I don't believe it! Your mom did all that? That's
awesome! Wait.
What about the rest? What happened after that? Garnet: The other Diamonds were
furious.
In a last-ditch attempt to wipe out the rebellion, the Diamonds launched a
direct attack against Earth, and in their fury, they used their powers to end
the fighting once and for all.
[Twinkle! Zap!.]
[Music.]
I predict this story won't have a happy ending.
We were all told different stories.
But they all ended the same way.
With Rose Quartz beingdefeated.
This new version of the story is even worse! So, she was great, and they beat
her? What are we supposed to get out of this that we can never win?! We haven't
yet, but we can, and we will.
They said they annihilated Rose's rebellion, but here we are.
They said they annihilated all of you on Homeworld, but here you are.
They think they have us on the run, but they're the ones that are running from
the truth.
And the truth is weareeverywhere! But how many more of us can there be? Way
more than you think! I was only on Homeworld for, like, an hour before I ran in
to you guys.
There must be Off Colors all over the place.
Rose used to say there was something about Earth something that set Gems free.
But it's not just Earth.
Look at you.
Love, freedom it's universal.
You all prove it every moment you live as yourselves.
You can show everyone.
Wecan do that? Not while we're floating out here like sitting ducks.
Fluorite, let's take another look at that engine.
- Yes! - Okay! - Yeah! - Fluorite: Lars.
Before we can activate the thrusters, we're going to need to restart the core.
How do we do that? We'll figure it out together.
Hey, uh, Garnet? When Connie and I were stranded on the Jungle Moon, I we saw
something a visionof Pink Diamond.
Hmm.
When Blue Diamond came to Earth, I had dreams where I saw through her eyes and
I was crying her tears.
If I'm having the same dreams about Pink Diamond, what if that means she's
still out there? She's gone, Steven.
Your mother made sure of that.
But I felt such a strong connection.
You have empathetic powers that other Gems don't have.
You're unusual, Steven, like them and like me.
It's not something to fear.
It's something to celebrate.
Come on, come on.
Oh, strange.
The core should have come online by now.
I predict that Captain Lars will be pressing the wrong button.
Oh.
Yes! We did it! [Music.]
Does that mean you can get back to Earth? Notquite.
The nova thrusters still needrepairs.
We can hit up the nearest colony for parts.
Rhodonite, tell me there's one nearby.
Well, we aren't far from one of Yellow Diamond's asteroid mines.
But that place will be crawling with Agates, Captain.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So are we.
Let's show 'em!

**** The Big Show ****
1 [Static.]
But I'd really rather be Eating your brain - Steven: Whoo-hoo! - Just another
hot track from Sadie Killer and the Suspects.
- How's it sound, Sour Cream? - Here, check it out.
Buck: Hey, Steven.
How's the footage coming? [Chuckles.]
Great! Your documentation of our humble beginnings will be important when we
become a pop-culture phenomenon.
Okay, but why are you recording it on that giant shoe box? It's my dad's old
camcorder.
These are your early days.
The footage has to look old.
I think I could get a more guttural scream on the chorus if I rest my voice a
little.
[Footsteps approach.]
Barb: Sadie! Could you give me a hand with the gro Oh! Didn't realize you had
practice today.
Hey, kids! - Hi, Ms.
Miller.
- Hi, Ms.
Miller.
Steven: Hi, Barb! Uh-oh.
There's a film crew! Good thing us Millers only have good angles, huh? Mo-o-o-
o-o-m! Okay, okay.
I know the rule.
I'll stay out of your hair.
It's okay.
We're done for the night.
You know you can play while I'm in the house.
It won't bother me.
I'm old.
I can't hear anything! Heh! Okay.
Thanks, Mom.
What?! Huh?! Can't hear a thing! Let me know if you kids want to stick around
for dinner.
I'm making a salad that's mostly cheese.
Okay! Thanks, Mom! [Rock music playing on headphones.]
You said this is Sadie singing? Steven: Uh-huh.
This is good stuff! You should see them live.
Sadie has this alter ego, and Huh? Uh, you should see them live! - What?! - See
them live! It's awesome! [Mid-tempo rock music plays.]
Teens by day, we're all right Teens by day, but every night we're Sadie Killer
and the Suspects Whoa-oh-oh Sadie Killer and the Suspects Don't be scared, it's
the afternoon Don't be scared, but pretty soon we'll be Sadie Killer and the
Suspects Whoa-oh-oh Sadie Killer and the Suspects The moon is out, I'm feeling
strange It's making me shout, it's making me change You better watch out, it's
going to get loud I'm killing the stage, I'm killing the crowd And you're next.
[Plays note.]
Whoa! That was great! Sadie, you transform into a totally different person.
Steven: Yeah.
No more Sadie Miller.
She's Sadie Killer.
Heh heh.
Yeah.
It feelskind of freeing.
I can tell! And this whole look you guys have going is really fun! Nice wolf
man, Buck.
I'm a witch's cat.
We know our costumes look cheap.
But when we make it big, we're going to have the finest tombstone hats money
can buy.
But that's a long ways off.
We're still mostly playing, uh, well, basements.
That's where everyone starts.
Now you just got to work on the stuff that isn't music booking shows, making
merch, getting the word out.
Steven: Dad! You know how to do all that stuff! You could help them! What,
like, be their manager? Yeah! You taught me everything I know, Mr.
U.
I think you'd be a great manager.
- Yeah! - Yeah, come on! Ha! I'll take the job! Yeah! Yeah! Thanks, Mr.
Universe! And so it begins our rise to stardom, followed by the inevitable
infighting and creative disagreements that will tear us apart in a beautiful
explosion of emotions.
Don't worry.
That won't happen.
Ah, shoot.
Hey, Sunshine! It's your old friend, Mr.
Universe.
Are you still booking all the coolest bands at your club? Well, listen to this!
[Rock music playing.]
Oh, sorry.
It's probably hard to hear over the phone.
I'll e-mail you a link.
Yeah.
[Laughs.]
Talk to you soon.
Who was that? Oh, Sunshine Justice.
She's an old music buddy that owns a venue in Empire City.
[Computer dings.]
Oh! She replied.
"This is the absolute worst recording I've ever heard.
It's a shame because I love the song.
Let's get these kids on stage with some decent equipment"? - They've got a gig!
- Whoo! I'll e-mail her back right away! Yeah, yeah, yeah! It's a big stage, so
you're gonna have a lot of space we can fill up.
Isn't that fog machine really expensive? The Fog Of War is one of the best
units out there.
Go big! It's on my tab.
When you say, "Big," you mean, like, glow sticks in every color? Bigger! I'm
talking lasers! Lasers?! Special delivery.
I think this will get us through the show tomorrow and then some.
Check it.
Sadie: Oh-ho-ho! Nice! Scary and stylish.
Huh? The Fog Of War and our lasers and Barb! These all got your name on them,
Greg.
You building a new car wash or something? [Chuckles.]
It's all for Sadie Killer and the Suspects.
Huh? Your daughter's band.
I'm their manager.
What are you talking about, an old duffer like you managing a band? [Chuckles.]
Well, I may be old, but that didn't stop me from getting them a gig in In some
no-name city.
It's not a big deal.
"Sadie Killer and the Suspects, live at Empire Ci" [Gasps.]
My girl is playing in Empire City?! This is a huge deal! Oh, my gosh.
Geez.
If you need to carry all this stuff and your instruments, I-I can probably use
the mail truck if I ask nice.
And I can definitely use it if I don't ask.
Oh! And you'll need snacks for the road, and Mom! We've talked about this!
Steven: Uh, Sadie? The band is my thing, and I just want to be able to do it on
my own.
Right, right.
You need your space.
I understand.
You kids be safe and have a good show, huh? [Engine starts.]
Ready the cords.
Here I go.
Aah! [Laughter.]
Ohh.
Ugh.
My mom used to be so into my life.
It was suffocating.
But now I get to be Sadie Killer, and it's something that's totally mine, and I
know she's just waiting to get her hands on it.
Wow.
That's so funny.
How is it funny? It drives me nuts! Oh, no.
It's just back in the day, my parents didn't want anything to do with my music.
They thought I was throwing my life away.
They never came to one of my shows.
They never even wanted to hear about them.
Really? It's kind of amazing that your mom is excited about your band.
It's just really nice to see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I-I guess you're right.
Jenny: Are you ready, Sadie Killer? - Yeah! - Aah! I'm so excited! It's our big
first show! - Yeah! - Me, too.
- The venue! - The venue! I love enthusiasm.
And we got about six more cameras in the back of the van.
What do you mean, you don't know how to tie a tie? Yeah.
Like, didn't your dad teach you? He used to wear them every day.
They were clip-ons.
Steven: Sadie! What's up? Are you nervous? No, no.
I'm just, um just getting ready.
Sounds like a big crowd out there.
Wait.
Is that Mom?! Does she think she can just show up in some wacky disguise and I
won't know it's her? It's so obvious! Maybe she should have gotten some costume
tips from you.
Greg: Okay, guys.
You're on in 5.
[Slow music plays.]
[Tempo increases.]
[Music continues.]
I used to be sick Sick and tired Delirious, dizzy, terrified But I'm suddenly
up and out of bed You'd never believe I was almost Why can't you see me? Why
can't you see me? I think I might be A gh-gh-gh-ghost Awwwww! Can't you see
that I exist And I don't need an exorcist To let me out? Look at me, and I'll
appear Why can't you see that I'm right here? That I'm right here Why can't you
see me? Why can't you see me? I think I might be A gh-gh-gh-ghost [Echoing.]
# Ghost # [Scattered cheers and applause.]
[Instrumental break.]
[Distorted voice.]
# I'm calling you from # The other side [Song ends, cheers and applause.]
Greg: You were all so amazing! Yeah, we were! Sadie, you nailed that ending.
Sadie: Oh! - Hey, Ma! - Sunshine Justice! How you been, Greg? Where'd you find
these kids? Reminds me of your old space gimmick, except people actually like
it.
Hey! [Chuckles.]
I'm just kidding.
You were very ahead of your time.
But Sadie Killer and the Suspects that crowd was going crazy.
You're really something.
You kids are welcome to play at the venue anytime.
- Aah! Aah! Aah! - Oh, yeah! [Snoring softly.]
Steven: You did great tonight! Thanks.
So, how does it feel to be a rock star? Weird.
I mean, good.
It's just I went all out thinking my mom was at the show.
I can't believe I kind of wanted her to be there.
Well, not even kind of.
I did.
There'll be other shows.
Why don't you tell her about the next one? Hey, Mr.
Universe, let's play our next show in Beach City.
I'll make it happen.
That's all, folks.
Thanks for watching.
[Music.]

City, but so much has changed lately.
I guess after all those abductions, everything couldn't just return to normal.
With Sadie rocking out and Lars in space, I can't even enjoy my regular snack
at the Big Donut.
What am I gonna do for breakfast now?! [Groans.]
[Grunts.]
[Doorbell rings.]
Wait a minute.
Big Donut is still open? [Gasps.]
Hello.
Welcome to the Big Donut.
Garnet? I have so many questions.
Just one moment.
You'll have to wait your turn.
[Soft music plays.]
[Ka-ching!.]
[Doorbell rings.]
Welcome to the Big Donut.
Tell me how I may serve you.
I never thought I'd see you working here.
- Have we fallen on hard times? - Oh, Steven.
This isn't about making ends meet.
This is about being random.
Are you serious? Oh, yes.
Idon't understand.
[Music.]
My future vision allows me to see down the rivers of possibility, granting me
insight into the possible realities our actions move us towards.
But that doesn't mean I can predict everything.
What I'm interested in are these extremely unlikely realities, so disconnected
from the natural course of events that I can't detect them.
When we act in unnatural ways, we create new, unforeseen paths, and arrive at
these pools of improbability.
Oh, so you want to do stuff you usually don't just to see what happens? I
didn't foresee you understanding that.
So, are we gonna clean up that coffee? That's what we'd normally do.
Let's see what happens to the world when we don't.
[Music.]
[Coffee drips.]
We are now dwelling in a totally new pool of improbability.
My future vision is useless here.
I'm scared but intrigued.
That's the spirit! Let's get even more intriguing! I quit! Come, Steven! [Soft
music plays.]
- So, what now? - Hmm Instead of selling food, let's order some.
Like what? Let's dopizza.
Now you're talking my language! Ordering now.
[Phone ringing.]
Fish Stew Pizza.
Uh, I want to order a pizza.
- 10 pizzas! - No, 20 pizzas! Toppings? Um - Surprise me.
- Now you're getting it! I guess deliver it to the Temple.
No That's just what they'll be expecting.
Go weirder! Deliver it to the ocean.
No, no, no! To Kansas! No, to the moon! I don't think that's within our
delivery radius.
Remember.
Improbable, not impossible.
Where's the last place they'd expect to deliver a pizza? Oh! Deliver it to Fish
Stew Pizza.
So, like, this is for pick-up? Now think, Steven, about what you typically do
when you obtain pizza.
Hmm Eat it? In this timeline, we do the opposite of that.
Hey, you! Have a pizza! [Grunts.]
Hey, thanks! [Music.]
[Seagulls squawking.]
One more pizza to deliver.
Hey, Vidalia's house is around here.
Let's bring her the last pie.
Now, that would be nice.
She must be upset that her son was taken into space by those Homeworld gems.
You mean Onion? He isn't in space.
He's right over there.
Sorry, I I must be thinking of a different timeline.
Okay Well, I'm sure Vidalia would still like some pizza even if her kid is
still on Earth.
Let's go swing by.
[Knock on door.]
Mother Onion! Open up! Vidalia: In the garage! [Music.]
Get excited for pizza! We got pepper flakes, and we're not afraid to use 'em!
Ahh! Wait a minute.
Steven? What are you guys doing here? Trying to scare me to death? Oh, sorry.
We were just trying to bring you a pizza in the most unlikely way possible.
Want a slice? Sure, I could use a break.
I've been working on this still life of a stepstool, but I just don't feel
inspired.
[Music.]
Paint me like one of your Amethysts.
Paint me, too! So you wanna be my muse, eh? If it's not too much trouble.
I promise to be very inspiring.
Hmm Yeah, I think this is just what I needed.
Strike a pose! It's struck.
Okay, don't move.
I need to capture your essence.
[Music.]
[Groaning.]
Garnet? How long do you see me holding still? Who knows? The odds of us being
here are so slim, I can't even [Clanging in distance.]
Uh, Garnet? [Music.]
Steven, look.
Ba-ba-b-b baby kitten? Is it possible that we chase that sweet cat? It it's up
to you, Steven.
Yes? Don't ask me.
Tell me.
Yes! - Whoa! - Huh? [Music.]
Sorry, Vidalia! Maybe next time! But wait! Your essence! [Music.]
That's one fast kitten.
You think we can catch it? If we don't lose sight of it.
[Music.]
[Kittens meowing.]
Steven: Aww There's more of them.
[Meowing continues.]
Aww, and they have no food.
Aww, and they have no one to take care of them! Garnet, we got to help these
kittens.
Look at you! You're just babies.
Who knows what would've happened to them if we didn't find them? Everything's
gonna be just fine.
We've got you.
[Meowing continues.]
Here's the last one.
Or wait.
All right.
I think we got to stop being random and figure out what we can do for these
kittens.
Garnet, can you use your future vision? What should we do next? Garnet? There's
so manycats.
So many possibilities.
It's too much? Okay, can you focus on one? What's this one's future? I I I
don't know! I don't know anything anymore! [Thunder rumbling.]
Are you okay? Steven, lately, I've felt so lost.
Don't worry.
I remember the way back to town.
Oh, it's not just that.
It's you.
You've made so many decisions I didn't expect giving yourself up to Homeworld,
coming back through Lion's mane.
The future that you created was so improbable that I didn't see it coming at
all, and now I can't understand where this timeline is going.
We're on the outskirts of the possible, following trickles to who knows where.
Everyone's looking to me for answers.
I can't stand it! It's so hard for me to just exist in the first place, Steven.
I want to love being alive.
I want to love that there are so many possibilities, but I'm the one with this
ability, so I've got to be our guide.
I thought, if I could use my future vision to jump into improbable futures, I
could get out ahead of the next big, unexpected change, but I don't know what
I'm doing here! I can't tell what's probable anymore! Anything could happen!
Anything could happen to these cats! [Kittens meowing.]
That's true, but maybe instead of thinking of all the things that could happen,
let's just pick the thing we want to happen and do that.
So, what do you want to happen next? I want to get these cats out of the rain.
[Music.]
And then what? Okay, sounds good.
Thank you so much.
Great news.
The shelter has a foster program.
They said they can pick up the cats tomorrow.
Thank goodness.
Whew.
Glad to hear it! How are you little guys holding up? Anyone need to use the
bathroom? Make a phone call? [Laughs.]
You guys are gonna be just fine.
- I think I get it.
- Hm? Why my future vision has been so off.
I have to change the way I think about you.
What? I've been looking into probable futures where you act like a child.
I keep expecting you to run from responsibility and to turn to me for help, but
you don't do that anymore.
Those futures aren't probable at all.
There's nothing wrong with this timeline or my future vision.
I just need to factor in that you've grown up.
[Laughs.]
I guess I have, but it's only because I'm trying to be more like you.
You always know what to do.
Not always.
Okay, most of the time.
I want to adopt this one.
There's something about her.
- Really? Is that a probable future? - It is now.
Besides, I've missed having someone cute and vulnerable to take care of.
I think I'll call her "Steven.
" Isn't that gonna get confusing? All right, then.
Cat Steven.
Oh, my gosh! Wow! O-Oh, okay.
This is the best! What, you're adopting one? Too bad I couldn't get her in your
portrait, which I managed to finish, by the way.
[Gasps.]
Really? What about our essence? Well, I fudged it, but I think I got it.
[Both gasp.]
[Waves crashing.]
[Kitten purring.]
[Music.]

Lars
****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e16 Episode Script ******
**** Letters to Lars ****
Lars: Captain's log I think it's Friday.
I've ordered Rhodonite to do a spectral scan of the system.
Hopefully, one of these asteroids has the Flotanium deposits we need to get our
warp engines back online.
Hmm.
[Grunts.]
What now, Steven? A letter? Steven: "Dear Lars, how's space? Is it still big?
You don't have to answer that right now.
This is a letter.
Since you're away from home, I thought I'd fill you in on what's been going on
at Beach City.
Everyone misses you so much.
Since Sadie is busy with the band, no one is around to open up the Big Donut.
" [Sighs.]
Oh, come on.
Are they still not open? Ugh.
I know Sadie quit a while ago, but why the heck isn't Lars here to pick up the
slack? Uh, Ronaldo, Lars is in space.
[Laughs.]
Good one, Steven.
I needed that.
You're serious? Don't you remember when everyone in town was abducted by Gems?
Mayor Dewey had to give all those speeches about it.
Do you believe everything the government tells you? I'm the one who told the
government.
Wait, what? - So that means - Mm-hmm.
So Lars is really in space? - Mm-hmm.
- Is he in danger? - Surrounded by aliens? - All of the above.
This is a nightmare.
I'm the one who should be in space! Why does Lars get to be whisked away into
the infinite cosmos on an adventure of a lifetime? It's so ironic it hurts my
soul.
[Sobbing.]
There, there.
Morning, Universe.
Oh, good morning.
Still not open, huh? I guess me and the Big Donut have a lot in common now.
We're both empty inside.
Steven: "As far as local politics, Mayor Dewey isn't mayor anymore.
There was an election and Nanefua won with her platform of working together.
" Nanefua: So we are all in agreement, yes? In the event of a Gem-related
emergency, everyone should go to the newly-designated shelters.
Me and Garnet can take care of food rations.
Anyone know a good, non-perishable brand of chaps? You can also put some pizza
ingredients on ice just in case.
That's a great idea, Garnet.
We can ask all the local restaurants to pitch in food in case we have to hide
for awhile.
These all seem like great plans, but how are you going to get in contact with
everyone when there is an emergency? This may be a small town, but it's a big
small town.
Oh, Mayor Gunga, I could drive you around while you use the loudspeaker to
spread the word through town.
Cheese on bread! That's a good idea.
While Jenny does that, I can take to the boardwalk on foot and let all the
businesses know what's up.
And as soon as we know of any impending danger, I'll give everyone a call on my
cellular phone.
It might be easier if you just sent out a mass text.
What number do I call for mass text? Pearl, is this your first cell phone?
Maybe.
Is there anything else we can do to beef up the town's security? It would be
nice if we could have some kind of lookout.
Maybe I'll pick up one of the high-powered telescopes for the lighthouse or
something.
I volunteer! I love looking out.
If I can't be in space, then I can at least look at it.
Nanefua: This is beautiful.
Ronaldo, Greg, you're on lookout duty.
Kiki, Pearl, you are in charge of communication.
Steven, Garnet, you call for rations.
And Jenny and I will spread the word about the plan.
Now everyone is helping to make our town safe.
Everyone except me.
Aww.
Oh, you made things awkward.
Steven: "Sadie Killer and the Suspects are still going strong.
They're gearing up for a huge show right here in Beach City.
I hope you can make it back in time to see them play.
" And just as the chorus is finishing up, I'll grab this fake but very
realistic chainsaw, and then Steven will hit me with the lights, and we'll all
scream.
Aah.
Aah.
And then I'll come out.
Oogity boogity.
I don't think you get it, Dad.
We're going for scary scary, not ha-ha scary.
Oh.
All right.
I just wanted to help.
Did you cut holes in my bedsheets? Steven: "Jamie the mailman has been making a
lot of progress establishing a local theater scene.
He's done a bunch of one-man shows and even started teaching improv.
" People of Beach City, are you ready to laugh your butts off? I am! We got a
killer lineup for you tonight, so please welcome the Beach City Laugh Guards.
Whoo! Yeah! Now all we need to get started is a single word from the audience.
Pearl: Steven! We do a scene about Steven every week.
Well, I think those scenes are good.
Uh, spaghetti! No.
No.
Uh, car.
No.
That's not good.
Oh, how about plumber? I heard "plumber.
" And now the Beach City Laugh Guards will perform a completely improvised
scene based on the word plumber.
No.
Do Steven! Wait, cats! And no more suggestions for the rest of the show.
Thanks for coming out on such short notice.
My sink is clogged.
Well, looks like we're going to need one of these.
[Steven laughs.]
No, no, no.
Cut.
Stop.
Notes Barb, love how you set up the scene.
Amethyst, you don't have to "become" a plunger.
Just pretend to have one.
Observe and learn.
Ah Ooh.
Uh - What? - Wow.
That's way too confusing.
You could be holding anything.
I'm holding a plunger.
Pearl: Oh.
I thought you were holding a long, skinny submarine sandwich.
Steven: Pearl! Be nice.
It's obviously much more clear if you can see the actual plunger.
She's got a point, there, dude.
[Laughs.]
Looks like I improved improv.
Dewey: Did I miss my cue? Oh.
Whatever.
Hello, ladies.
It's me, the waiter in this restaurant.
Can I offer you some more worms? Blackout.
It was better than last week.
Steven: "Anyways, my dad is still rich even after buying that telescope, so
he's been trying out rich people sports.
He an Garnet have been playing tennis on the weekends.
" [Panting.]
Garnet, this is a little intense for a warm-up.
Maybe we could try a light volley? This is light.
Being rich has made you week.
Oh, hey, tennis.
Room for one m Ow! Steven: "In other sports-related news, Beach City
Underground Wrestling has been intense lately.
The Marmalade Boys fought each other in, you guessed it, marmalade.
The crowd was eating it up, but not literally because that would be gross.
Concrete Heat faced off against the Wolf of Wall Street inside a steel cage,
and the Good-Looking Gang finally lost the Tag-Team Title to the Sea Wasp and
Shark-o-mania.
I know you don't need to eat anymore, but I thought you'd still be interested
in the local french fry scene in Beach City.
Peedee started his very own food truck.
He's not old enough to drive yet, though, so it's kind of just another fry
stand.
" Hey, Steven.
What will it be? What have you got? Well, I deal exclusively in tater tots now.
That's great, Peedee.
Can I get the bits? Uh, why don't you try the tots? They're the fry of the
future.
Do the tots have bits? [Sighs.]
I'll get you the bits.
I like your super-cool truck, Peedee.
I love the giant potato on the top.
Oh, thanks.
It actually used to be the Mayor Mobile.
I just painted over Mayor Dewey's head.
It's a good thing that his head was so big and lumpy.
Yeah.
The new city board practically just gave it to me, too.
It's like they wanted nothing to do with it anymore.
Everything has been pretty great for me since Nanefua became mayor.
Oh, no.
All right.
I got the bits.
Steven? [Sighs.]
Mayor Dewey, wait! You know, Universe, seeing my old Mayor Mobile turned into a
giant potato made me realize that nothing is like it used to be.
My old life, my old town, my old citizens, they've all changed.
They've all outgrown me, I suppose.
Well, of course everyone is changing.
Nothing can stay the same forever.
You know what I miss the most about being the mayor? The little things, getting
dressed and ready for work, walking down the boardwalk seeing everyone's
smiling faces, yes.
Knowing I had a place in this town.
I used to look forward to it every day, just like the people of this town used
to look forward to their morning donut.
I guess these days no one gets what they want.
Wait a second.
I have an idea.
"And so Mayor Dewey started working at the Big Donut.
It seemed as if the entire town showed up for the grand reopening.
The whole thing filled Mr.
Dewey with a new sense of purpose.
He's really changing things up, too.
Well, not really, but he is naming all the donuts after himself.
" Next in line, please.
I'll have a regular glazed.
One Classic Dewey coming up.
And how about a freshly fried Dewey Roll on the house? Take it easy, Billy.
You're going to go out of business.
Ha ha! You're cute.
Steven: "But there is one donut that's not named after Dewey.
He let me name a donut after you.
It's a pink donut with pink sprinkles.
I call it the Pink Lars.
Even though you're in space, there's still a part of you here in sweet,
delicious donut form.
You got to try one when you get back.
Anyway, hope this letter finds you in good spirits.
Love, Steven.
" I appreciate the letter, but why did you write this if you were just going to
tell me everything in person anyway? Sometimes it's nice to be read to.
You realize I don't know who half of these people are, right? Like, who the
heck is Peridot? Someone who misses you every day, I think.
You know what? You haven't met before.
I'll have to introduce you when you get back to Earth.
Huh.
Thanks for the letter, Steven.
[Music.]

1 - Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always
save the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a
way # - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in

Night, Peridot.
Nothing left to do but dream.
Hmm.
Ronaldo: Steven! [Pounding on door.]
Steven! Steven! Ronaldo, it's the middle of the night.
You have to come to the lighthouse.
I've found something weird.
You've found something weird every day since my dad got you that telescope.
I know.
I'm amazing.
You won't believe my latest discovery.
There's something on the moon.
Can't you call Nanefua? Not a fourth time.
Hmm.
This is the moon base.
It's always been there.
You have a moon base?! I have so many questions.
One Why didn't you tell me about your moon base? Two Take me to your moon base.
Three Why does it look like a barn? It doesn't look like a Wait, what? ##
Lapis? Whoa! Thanks, Lion.
That super warp takes a lot out of you, huh? [Yawns.]
[Yawns.]
You and me both, buddy.
You stay here and rest up, okay? ## ## Why would Lapis bring the Barn to the
moon? Thought she wanted to get as far away from Earth as possible.
## Lapis? Lapis Lazuli? This is weird.
All the meep morps are still here, but no Lapis.
Now, what is going on? [Humming in distance.]
## Lapis? ## - Lapis! - [Gasps.]
Steven.
Hup! I can't believe it.
It's so good to see you again.
Oh, really? What's going on? I-I thought you'd be halfway across the galaxy by
now.
Aren't you worried about the Diamonds coming to attack? I gotdistracted.
By this orb thing? What is it? Promise you won't judge me.
I sleep with a teddy bear.
No judgments.
Wha Wha-huh? Beach City? Please explain this to me.
This orb is an observation device.
The Diamonds use them to watch activity on their colonies from afar.
Wow.
Can I try? Sure.
Whoa.
But, Lapis, what are you using it for? [Sighs.]
## ## ## You're spying on us? Well, I wouldn't call it spying because that
would make me feel bad.
Oh, Lapis.
I couldn't stand not knowing what was going on.
I'm still terrified of the Diamonds coming to Earth, but I got just outside the
Milky Way and I felt so lonely.
So why didn't you just come back? I want to, but I just can't, not after the
way I left.
What would Peridot say? What if the Diamonds show up? What if something bad
happens? Well, what if something good happens? [Laughs.]
Uh, Lapis? You okay? ## It all became so lovely Those bluest skies above me
Those funny feelings I had never felt before I met you I thought I'd stay a
while I tried to learn to smile So many colors I had never even known Maybe
I'll find myself sitting on that distant shore Maybe I'm not alone ## Then I
see the colors fading Gentleness of light escaping Shadows of my fear invading
Have I seen this all before I know that there's something residing A terror
deep inside me I couldn't understand how you could be so bold Maybe I'll find
myself smiling on that distant shore Maybe I'm not alone I might have
overreacted about the Diamonds.
You really think they're coming? I don't even know anymore.
I've done so much because I was afraid.
I left Peridot behind.
I took the Barn and her morps.
Hey, at least she has Pumpkin.
[Sighs.]
I was so sure the Diamonds would destroy my new home that I did it myself.
It's like I'm back inside the mirror, except I put myself here.
Oh, the moon's not so bad.
Are you kidding? The moon sucks.
There's nothing here.
Maybe I'm tired of running away.
Maybe I'd rather be with everyone and be in danger than be safe and alone.
They'd be glad to have you back.
I don't know.
If I went back now, there's no way things could go back to how they were.
Yeah, but that's all right.
Things would just be different.
What do you mean? Well, what if you weren't way out in the country? You could
drop the Barn on the beach.
Then we'd all be neighbors.
I'd come over to borrow a cup of a sugar and you'd be like, "What's that?"
[Both laugh.]
[Yawns.]
When you go back, we should all hang out more.
Huh, when I go back.
- This is what you wanted.
- [Gasps.]
Lapis? Blue Diamond: You begged us for a colony of your own, and now all you
want to do is be rid of it.
First there were too many Organics.
Then their cities were too difficult to dismantle, and and now these Crystal
Gems.
We're tired of your excuses, Pink.
The Diamonds! This Rose Quartz can't hurt you.
You can't be swayed by a few unruly Gems.
Enough.
You must understand, you are a Diamond.
Everyone on this planet is looking to you.
You don't even have to do anything.
Just smile and wave.
Show everyone you're unfazed by this little uprising.
Your gems will fall into line, and these Crystal Gems will be no more.
As long as you are there to rule, this colony will be completed.
## [Gasps.]
## ## Mom's sword? Is that Pearl? [Screams.]
Steven, are you okay? Were you dreaming? II saw the Diamonds.
What? What are you talking about? I dreamt about them.
They were right in this room.
What does that mean? Are they coming? II don't know.
What if they are? What if they're close? Why else would you see them? Steven.
## Ugh! Lapis, hold on! ## Ah! Ahhh! Where are you going? As far from Earth as
I can! I'm leaving.
You should be used to that by now.
You don't have to run, Lapis.
Just Just stay with us.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I-I'm not like you and your friends, Steven.
I can't just let go of what happened to me.
I can't go through that again.
Would you rather be alone? - I'm sorry.
- Wait! ## ## Lion, I need you to take me to Pearl.

Pale Rose
****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e18 Episode Script ******
**** A Single Pale Rose ****
I watched the leader of the Crystal Gems, Rose Quartz, shatter Pink Diamond! So
how did a Rose Quartz, with no business being anywhere near Pink Diamond, get
so close in the first place? Aagh! I can't believe you've had your phone for a
month and you haven't used it at all! That's not true! I use it to tell the
time! Sigh.
Come here, P.
Ugh.
Let's change your wallpaper.
[Shutter clicks.]
Looks great! Okay, now texting is in the messages.
Just click on this green icon.
- Pearl, can I ask you someth - Hold on, Steve-o, I'm in the middle of a
demonstration! Okay, anyway, and you can type, I mean, pretty much anything you
want.
[Message chime.]
You really should have a case for this.
I do! Okay.
I have a bunch of actual phone cases in my room.
Hup! Don't throw that thing against a rock or anything until I'm back.
- Pearl - What is it, Steven? You remember how Mom shattered Pink Diamond?
Well, I was just wondering - if maybe you shattered Pink Diamond? - I I-it's
okay! You can tell me! [Grunting.]
Why can't you just talk to me about this?! I got the phone case.
Oh, yes! The phone case! Thank you, Amethyst! Ha ha whoops! So clumsy.
It's probably safer if I just keep it in here.
Wait, come on! Just put it in this, then put it in your head! What was that?
[Sighs.]
[Waves crashing, gulls crying.]
[Message chime.]
"I want to tell you, but I can't"?! [Vacuum running.]
Pearl, I'm ready to talk! - Uh, what?! - I-I got your text.
"I want to tell you but I can't," with a monkey emoji? Steven, I didn't send
that.
I haven't used my phone since I put it away this morning.
Maybe you butt dialed me with your gem? No, that's impossible.
Hang on, I'll pull it out, and we'll get to the bottom of this.
See, here.
See, I Maybe this? No.
Maybe this? No.
Maybe may-may this? - No.
- Pearl, are you okay? Ugh.
Where could I have put it? I know it's in there somewhere.
[Gasps.]
You just sent another one! ## Steven I need you to go inside my gem and find my
phone.
What? I-is it stuck in there or something!? There are certain things I can't
tell you, but I can tell you that I need my phone.
Please! I can bring you back out once you find what you're looking for.
- Your phone - Exactly! I'll keep your phone, text me with mine when you find
it.
Huh! [Humming.]
There's a Pearl inside Pearl's pearl? Oh, Steven! Where should I put you?
Certainly not with the spears.
Human paraphernalia? Personal items? Let's just go alphabetical.
S S-T Wait, no! Don't file me! You sent me in here for your cell phone! My
phone? Well, all right, let's see.
P-H-O- Ah, hmm.
Nothing Oh, it's a cellular phone! I must have put it under "C"! It should be
right here.
It should be right here! Unless some other me took it.
There's more of you in here? Oh, no, not here.
I made sure of that.
I'm very good at compartmentalizing everything.
That's why I get to be surface, and they have to be put away.
Well, if one of those Pearls has the phone, can you tell me where to find her?
Oh, you don't want to go where they are.
It's a mess.
Let's just stay here, where everything is alphabetized! Come on, I can handle
it! All right.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
[Waves lapping shore.]
This doesn't look like a mess.
It looks like the past.
[Sobbing.]
Oh, that kind of mess.
[Sobbing.]
Hey, Pearl inside Pearl inside Pearl's pearl.
You upset about the whole missing phone situation, too? No, it's Rose! What was
she thinking?! She can't have a baby! Well, this is awkward.
What am I going to do when she disappears? I'm going to lose her, just like I
lost my what was it you said? Your cell phone? [Wailing.]
My cell phone! Look, it's going to be okay! That's why you sent me in here, I'm
going to help you find it.
I think I know where it is.
It's probably where I lost everything else.
## Huh? It better not turn out that her phone was in her pocket or she left it
on the dresser or dropped it in the toilet.
Seems about as likely as putting it away in your repressed war memories.
Pearl? I mean, Pearl inside Pearl inside Pearl inside Pearl's pearl! Is this
really about your phone or what! We're the only ones left.
Homeworld they were all leaving.
We thought we'd won.
There was a bright light and everyone was - Why did I do it? - What do you
mean? Just tell me! ## [Grunting.]
Mom? I thought this was Pearl's What are you doing here? ## W-what?!
[Shouting.]
I I knew it! It was you who shattered her.
Pink Diamond? But I don't understand.
## The palanquin? [Indistinct whispering.]
And then you'll be done! It's going to be easy! There's got to be another way!
I mean, maybe Blue and yellow don't care! They never have! This is "Pink
Diamond's" colony.
We can end it all right here, right now.
You know this is crazy, right? Your status, my purpose none of it will matter
anymore.
This will change everything.
I know.
Isn't it exciting? [Sighs.]
It is! We can leave our old lives behind.
If this is really my world, I want to give it to the Crystal Gems.
I want to live here with human beings.
I want to live here with you! We'll both finally be free! - Okay, I'm ready! -
Pearl! I can't believe I'm going to do this.
I can't exactly shatter myself.
## ## ## ## [Blows, grunts.]
[Gasps.]
- Convincing? - Very much so, my diamond.
Soon it will be just "Rose.
" Wait.
There's one last thing I need to do.
- Yes? - No one can ever find out we did this.
I never want to look back.
So, for my last order to you as a diamond, please, let's never speak of this
again.
No one can know.
## [Gasps.]
Sorry to make you come all this way.
## ## ## - I know.
- I wanted to tell you for so long.
- Mom was Pink Diamond.
- Whaaaaat?!

Only Falling Apart
****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e19 Episode Script ******
**** Now We're Only Falling Apart ****
- Garnet: # We # - # Are the Crystal # - Steven: # Gems # - # we'll always save
the day # Steven: # and if you think we can't # All: # we'll always find a way
# - # that's why the people # - # of this world # Garnet: # believe in Garnet #
- # Amethyst # - # and Pearl # Steven: # And Steven! # Amethyst: Let me get
this straight.
Rose Quartz, leader of the Crystal Gems, Steven's mom, was actually Pink
Diamond? She faked her own shattering and reformed to be Rose all the time.
Pink Diamond's final command to me was that no one could know, but now that
Steven does, I can finally tell you all everything.
Whew! I mean, a pink lion, a pink sword and now a pink Diamond? If you told me
Rose invented cotton candy, I'd believe it.
Right, Garnet? Uh Garnet? Rose She she [Groaning.]
- Sapphire.
- She lied to us! She lied about everything! She held our hands, looked us
right in the eyes and told us to never question who we are as Garnet.
We never questioned ourselves or her.
We couldn't have known.
No.
You couldn't have known.
You never know what's going on.
- That's what I'm for.
- Sapphire But I never looked into her.
I trusted her.
- I let her make fools of us all.
- Sapphire, wait! Guys! What?! Please.
We could just stay calm and talk about this, right? - Let's just talk.
- Talk about what? How our relationship is based on a lie? What else is there
to say? - Ruby, I'm so sorry.
- Come on, Pearl.
Help me explain everything to Sapphire.
Right.
Sit tight, Ruby.
We'll go and get Sapphire.
Okay [Sobbing.]
Maybe she's here.
Steven: Sapphire! Sapphire: Everything we were running from, she was right
there all along, using us for her little war, smiling at us with those knowing
eyes, making me believe in a better future that I couldn't see because it
wasn't real, and now, here we are, our friends shattered and corrupted.
Of course she was Diamond.
What a long road she took to torture us like this.
It wasn't like that.
You know she didn't want anyone to get hurt.
I don't know that! I clearly don't know anything.
Pearl: You deserve to know everything.
I was given to Pink Diamond just a few thousand years before she was given the
Earth.
I was supposed to make her happy.
I just never could.
Could you imagine that running a colony would be this dull? I could imagine it
if you would like me to, my Diamond.
[Sighs.]
Show me the status of the prime kindergarten.
Yes, my Diamond.
The first Quartz soldiers are due to emerge soon.
[Gasps.]
Oh.
Finally, something exciting! Hurry! We've got to see this.
- Quickly! Turn it on.
- Yes, my Diamond.
Look at this, Pearl.
We're creating life from nothing.
Welcome to Earth.
[Sighs.]
I wish I could just be there.
I'll have us warped into the kindergarten at once, - my Diamond.
- W-What? No.
No.
If I went down to the kindergarten, I would never hear the end of it from
Yellow and Blue.
Oh, but could you imagine me down there, laughing and playing with the
Amethysts? Of course I can, my Diamond.
You look so happy.
I won't be so happy when Blue and Yellow find out.
- They won't find out.
- How's that? Because you look just like a Quartz.
- You changed your shape for a day.
- That's brilliant, Pearl.
- I'm glad I was able to help, my Di - [Chuckles.]
Down here.
- Pearl, look.
- Hup! Hup! Hup! This is incredible! We got to get down there and check it out!
Wha?! [Music.]
[Laughs.]
- Pearl, this is so - Out of my way! Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
These Amethyst guards can be so rude.
But, Pearl, don't you see what's happening? Huh? We're actually here, and I am
fitting right in.
None of that dumb salute.
Thank you so much for talking me into this.
I couldn't have done this on my own.
Uh you're welcome, my Diamond.
Shh.
Pearl, you're going to get us in trouble.
Sorry, my Quartz.
[Giggles.]
Hey, fellow Amethyst guards.
What are we all up to? There's two more from our unit that haven't emerged yet,
so we're going to wait for them.
Here comes one of them.
Oh, wow.
Look at you.
Welcome to Earth.
That is the first and nicest thing anyone - has ever said to me.
- What's going on here? Our orders were to move out as soon as you emerged! But
8XM hasn't emerged yet.
She can catch up with us later.
- Go! Go! Go! - Hup! Hup! Hup! Pearl: My Diamond, please.
Let's not draw any more attention ourselves - than we already have.
- Oh.
You're right.
- But things were getting really fun.
- What if we took some time to explore some of Earth's other features? [Gasps.]
Pearl, you're so smart.
So it was all just so she could get out and have some fun? Well, that's how it
started.
So this is Earth.
[Music.]
And this is just a small portion of the resources available - for making gems
on this planet.
- I have to see it all.
[Music.]
[Music.]
[Music.]
[Thunder rumbling.]
Is everything all right, my Diamond? You seem troubled.
All this life that's been growing wild here on Earth, none of it will survive
my invasion.
We're not creating life from nothing.
We're taking life and leaving nothing behind.
[Thunder crashing.]
Forgive me, my Diamond.
I shouldn't have brought you to such a place.
No.
I needed to see this.
So she did want to protect Earth.
She didn't realize what the colony was doing to the planet.
So what? She suddenly started to care about Earth? Why did she have to rope us
into all this? Why couldn't she just stop the colonization herself? She tried.
When she told the other Diamonds she didn't want to go through with the colony,
they told her to finish what she started.
When she told the other Diamonds she wanted to preserve life on Earth, they
created the Zoo and threw a handful of humans in.
She did everything she could as Pink Diamond, but her status meant nothing to
Blue and Yellow, so she decided to make a stand as someone they couldn't
ignore.
She was going to scare every Gem off the planet, but everything changed when
she saw your fusion.
[Music.]
Rose: I still can't believe it.
Only on Earth, don't you think? Only on Earth, where anything can happen.
A fusion of two completely different Gems! Can all Gems do that? How have I
never heard of this? I've only ever heard that it's unheard of.
Can you imagine what that must feel Fusion activate! Whoa! Oh.
I thought if a Ruby and a Sapphire, but you're a Diamond.
Forgive me.
What am I doing? I-I need to be replaced immediately.
- No.
- But I've been imagining things.
Even when you haven't asked me to, I imagined that I ran away and met you here
on Earth, a Rose Quartz, and I'm not yours, but I make you so happy anyway.
Isn't that ridiculous? Tell me to stop.
Please don't ever stop.
[Music.]
- This is very not allowed.
- [Gasps.]
That fusion.
We never should have left her there with Blue.
Who knows what sort of horrible punishment [Rustling.]
Ouch.
Aah! We didn't mean to fuse.
Well, we did this time.
We'll unfuse.
We'llwe'llwe'll No.
No.
Please.
I'm glad to see you again.
Pearl: Before Garnet, Rose was only fighting for Earth, but Garnet changed
everything.
Rose wanted to fight for her.
She wanted to fight for Gems, and maybe, she was foolish and maybe even
selfish, but she was - Following us.
- What? This whole time, we thought we were following her, but she was
following us.
How could she not after you swept her off her feet? - Wha what? Me? - Steven:
Are you kidding? You took her on this whirlwind tour of Earth, and then she
wanted to live here with you forever.
That's just how I felt when I came here with Ruby! Oh, no.
We have to get back right away.
Ruby, I'm so sorry! Where Huh? Oh, no.

Problem
****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e20 Episode Script ******
**** What's Your Problem ****
Ruby, I'm so sorry! Where Huh? Oh, no.
Sapphire, you were right.
I need some time to think.
So I am running away.
Ruby.
This can't be happening! Oh, Ruby! I'm so sorry! You left before I could take
back all the horrible things I said to you! Well, Amethyst was with her.
Right? Maybe she knows where she went.
Amethyst, have you seen Ruby? Yeah.
I've seen her.
She asked me for pen and paper awhile ago.
- Why? - Because she ran away! Did you see where she went? I don't know.
Maybe she'll come back! It's not my job to babysit her.
Hey, Steven! Get over here.
I need a player two.
Hold on a second, Amethyst.
Do you see her coming back in your future vision, Sapphire? Oh, maybe! But
she's so wonderful and spontaneous.
I have no idea what she Why would she be a cowboy? [Sobbing.]
There, there.
It's going to be okay.
She's going to come back.
She's got to come back.
If she doesn't, then there would be no more Garnet, and what on Earth would we
do without Garnet? Oh, Pearl.
How will I ever get her back? I don't know! You two are incredible together! It
can't be over! It can't! Oh, why don't you two take all of this into the
temple? Steven and I are going to play some video games.
No.
No.
It's okay.
Don't worry, Sapphire.
- I'm going to go out and find Ruby! - What? I'll be right back with her in no
time.
[Both sobbing.]
Yo, Steven! Wait up! I'm coming too.
[Gulls crying, waves crashing.]
I don't think Ruby used the warp path.
She said she was running away, not warping away, and she's usually pretty
literal.
We just need to figure out which direction she went.
So how do we do that? Let's try putting ourselves in Ruby's shoes.
[Laughs.]
Now what? Amethyst, be serious.
She could only have gone in one of two directions, either into town or into the
ocean.
Hmm Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! [Gurgling.]
Ruby! Okay, so she wasn't underwater.
- Ruby! - Ruby? Ruby? I really don't think she's hiding under a seashell.
Maybe Ruby shape-shifted really small! You never know.
What a spacious house! [Gasps.]
I'll keep it.
Amethyst, you know I love these great goofs, but I'm worried about Ruby.
Can we stop messing around and turn back to normal? You're the boss.
We need to think.
Where would Ruby go if she ran away? Is there anyone in town that she knows?
Doesn't look like she's here.
- Dead end, huh? - We've just got to keep looking.
[Music.]
[No dialog.]
[Music continues.]
She's not in here either.
This is where I would go if I was feeling down.
Pizza always cheers me up.
So why don't we get some? But we haven't found Ruby yet.
Steven, it's cool you want to help Ruby, but what about you? Come on! Let's
forget about Ruby for a moment and get some pizza! I'm not hungry! [Stomach
gurgling.]
Maybe I'm a little hungry! Here's your pizza with literally all the toppings.
Ye-e-e-es! Oh, and here.
You're going to need these.
Thanks! Yeah! Thanks, man! You're welcome! So Pink diamond, huh? Yeah.
Rose quartz, eh? Mm-hmm.
So all this time, you thought Rose was this rebel leader, but she was just
rebelling against herself? Apparently.
And the diamond that Rose supposedly shattered, I mean, you've got it! It's
right there under your shirt.
Yeah.
So how are you feeling? I feel confused.
I thought I had really finally got it that Mom didn't have everything figured
out even though everyone put her way up on this pedestal, but now I guess she's
royalty too.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I'm relieved that she didn't shatter anyone, but she lied to everyone! I mean,
I'm not surprised.
I knew she was a liar.
But this is just so much.
But, like, aren't you mad? Kind of.
I don't know.
I can see how she was good and bad, and bad and good.
But I guess what really matters right now is how hard Garnet took it.
But what about you?! She's your mom! You were always under all of this pressure
to be like her, but was she even like her? Was anyone ever like her? She was
supposed to be so great.
She was supposed to know everything.
She was supposed to make everything better.
It's not fair! We shouldn't have to deal with any of this! We shouldn't have to
fix any of this! We weren't around for her stupid war! This is everyone else's
problem.
This is nothing to do with me.
And you! Th This has nothing to with you! Amethyst, hold on a second.
Are you okay? No! I mean, yes! Of course I'm okay! I'm trying to find out how
you feel about all of this! She's your mom.
Okay? It doesn't really affect me.
Dude, Kiki, I just got the biggest tip from Mr.
Universe, and I'm totally going to buy those boots now! Whoa! Seriously? Yeah!
He was like all the way out on Brooding Hill, which is totally out of our
delivery radius, comforting some little friend.
She must have been crying because she was, like, really red.
Both: Ruby! Let me handle this, Steven.
No more adults should be putting anything else on you! Just let someone else
take care of it for once! Amethyst, wait! There's someone else who needs help
even more, and it's you! Amethyst, we need to talk! Can't now, bud! I'm going
to find Ruby! [Music.]
Let me help you with your feelings! Get off of my back, dude! Come on! You can
talk to me! Aah! [Music.]
If you'll open up, you'll feel so much better! Come on! You're hiding
something! Get out of my head, Steven! Am I getting too personal? Dude, you're
literally inside my head! Amethyst, look out! We're crashing! But how does that
make you feel? [Music.]
[Crash.]
Amethyst? You want to know how I feel, Steven? I thought I was pretty clear
about that.
I thought I was pretty clear, too! I feel like I don't want to say, "What about
me?" Okay! And I don't want to be bent out of shape.
I don't want to be stuck in the past.
And I'm not responsible for what Rose did! None of us are! Not you.
Not Pearl.
And not Garnet! But I am responsible for me.
And right now, I am not going to dump another 1,000-year-old complex on you or
anybody else.
I am ending it right here! I am the ding dong sunshine future.
Your friend forever! And I'm not going to fall apart on you.
Amethyst So, Steven, how do you feel? Pretty good.
Good.
[Waves crashing.]
Have you been trying to cheer me up this whole time? Yes! Jeez! Don't you know
you deserve it, you great person? [Music.]
- Hey, Amethyst.
- What? I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think you're officially
the most mature Crystal Gem.
Oh, no! Gross! That's what this is, isn't it? Yeah, pretty much.
No! No-o-o! [Chuckles.]
You still want to find Ruby? - Yeah.
- All right.
Let's go.
[Music.]
- There they are! - Target spotted.
Let's go in for a landing.

Question
****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e21 Episode Script ******
**** The Question ****
1 - Garnet: We - Are the Crystal - Steven: Gems - we'll always save the day
Steven: and if you think we can't All: we'll always find a way - that's why the
people - of this world Garnet: believe in Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl Steven:
And Steven! - Ruby.
- Oh boy.
So she's all the way out here.
After everything Sapphire said, she must be heartbroken.
H-hey guys! Steven?! How'd you find me? - We sensed you.
- We heard you ordered pizza.
Ruby was just telling me about your mom.
Oh.
Are you okay? Well, I fell in love with Rose Quartz and she fell in love with
Mr.
Universe.
Sure she never told me she used to be pink diamond, but [Chuckles.]
I never told her I used to be Gregory Demayo.
So, how're you holding up, Ruby? I'm okay.
Want a slice? Uh Thank you Wait, really? You seemed so sad before! Yeah, but me
and Greg talked it out.
I'm fine now.
Are you sure? Yeah.
Sapphire was kinda right about everything.
We really did stay Garnet because Rose told us we were The answer.
It's my first time really thinking about it.
It's my first time really thinking about Me! What do you mean? Back when I
emerged, the first thing I did was get crammed together with a bunch of other
Rubies, then I was with Sapphire all the time.
I was always checking in with someone, but now I can go wherever the wind takes
me! I'm up here, eating pizza, reading comics! I dunno if Sapphire wants to
read comics! I don't have to know! The rest of my life could be like this! I
don't have to be Garnet I could be on my own! - Sure! - I guess Wha-a-a-a-at?!
B-b-b-but but you guys love each other! You're my favorite couple! Y-you're
like sugar and flour! I love eating them separately but I still want cake! I'm
sure Sapphire would want I'm not fussed about what Sapphire wants.
I'm seeing my own future now, and it's nothin' but Ruby! [Whimpering.]
Relax, kiddo.
This could be what she needs.
But Dad! What if they never form Garnet again?! We gotta get 'em back together!
W-Whoa! Th-that's not our call to make! Ruby's gotta want that for herself.
If it's not what Ruby wants, then it's not what Garnet wants, right? Mmm I
guess so So where you going after this, dude? You just gonna stay out here? I
wanna live free! One with the wilderness! Facing danger at every turn! Not
needin' nothin' or nobody to get me by! Just like this guy! [Dolphin squeaks.]
Hmm, do you mean something like this? [Whiplash.]
[Music.]
[Gasp.]
That's even better! The open plain! That's where I wanna go! I think I know
just the place.
I'll get you there! Thank you! Hup! All right, all right I-if this is how it's
gotta be I'll support Ruby in her quest for emotional growth.
Yeehaw! Pa pow! Pa pow! Hup! Bang bang bang!! Woo-hoo! [Engine sputtering.]
[Brakes screeching.]
Y'all ready to Wild West it up? [Western Music.]
[Whiplash crack.]
[Footsteps.]
[Western guitar music.]
Here I am.
On the open range.
At least you understand me, Horsey.
Oh! Ruby, you need a steed! I'm always down for a little horsin' around
[Grunting.]
[Whinnying.]
Giddyup.
[Eagle call.]
[Horse clops.]
How's it goin, Ruby? Feel like a real cowboy now? Yep.
I sure reckon I do.
Sorry I gotta be a yellow belly about this, but we don't even have a map.
I think we're just gonna get ourselves lost.
[Snorts.]
I already am lost.
That's why I came out here to find myself.
It's a dead end.
This is what I mean.
What's behind this brush? I don't know! Sapphire ain't here to predict for me.
This is my chance to find out for myself! Hup! Aaahhh! Oh jiminy! Ruby?!
[Panting.]
Wh Whoa! I had no idea this ravine was here! Huh! I almost fell down there and
it was all my choice! Yee haw! Independence! [Laughing & cheering.]
[Country music.]
This ol' Ruby rider Is Ruby ridin' alone She's a sturdy Solitary stone This ol'
Ruby rider Not a fusion no more Now the dirt and the dust And the danger is my
new home [Music continues.]
I used to think I Would always be by your side But lately you've been rather
cold - Ah-ah-ah - One look in your eye Could make an honest gem cry But Ruby
Rider don't need no one to hold [Whistling.]
Wow, Ruby's really getting into this.
Seriously! I just taught her how to play guitar like ten minutes ago! No, Dad,
I-I mean the whole "cowboy being alone" thing.
I've never seen her like this before.
She seems really happy.
[Music continues.]
This ol' Ruby rider Is Ruby ridin' alone She's a sturdy Solitary stone Yeehaw.
[snoring.]
[Snoring whinny.]
- Hey Ruby! - Hm? Y'know I got-really scared when you said you didn't wanna
fuse with Sapphire anymore.
I felt like I was losing someone I cared about, but I saw how much fun you were
having today.
All this buckerooing really suits you.
I'm sorry I tried to push you back into being Garnet.
It's not true.
- Huh? - That stuff I sang about It's not true! W-w-what?! I mean I did have a
lot of fun today.
I loved it! But the whole time I [Sighs.]
I kept thinking about how much more fun I'd have if I were with her.
Sapphire was always there with me.
I'd feel her smile just like it was mine It's so lonely now.
[Groans.]
That's lame, right?! I came here to be my own gem, but I'm still thinking about
what she'd like, what she'd want, all the time! Turns out I'm no good at not
needin' nobody.
C'mon, that's not lame! You led us on a frontier adventure! You're still the
same Ruby who did all that stuff, even if you're thinking of someone.
Look at our friend Lonesome Lasso.
They call him that 'cause he's lonesome! "I miss Sally May!" He's still a
rootin' tootin' cowboy blazin' his own trails.
But he loves someone too.
Well, if I'm makin my own decisions, then I'll decide I wanna be with Sapphire.
[Sighs.]
I mean, I gotta ask her first.
I just don't want it to feel like we're going back to how things used to be
back when someone else told us to be together.
I want it to feel different.
Wait a sec! What do you think of this?! [Gasp.]
[Gulls crying.]
[Door creaks.]
[Gasp.]
Steven! Did you find Ruby?! She's outside.
She's got something to say to you.
[Music.]
Ruby! Ruby, I'm so sorry!! I should've never said those awful things to you,
that we didn't matter anymore.
I shouldn't've pushed you away like that.
I was wrong! [Music.]
Pa-tooey.
Nah.
.
you were right.
Hup! [Whinnies.]
Someone else told us we were the answer.
But I don't believe that anymore.
At least not till I hear it from you.
[Music.]
Sapphire Will you marry me?! What?! [Laughing.]
Marry you?! Yeah! This way we can be together even when we're apart! This time,
being Garnet will be our decision! Whaddaya say?! - Of course! - Yee-haw!!
Mmnngg.
I've been waiting to kiss your cute face! Woo! [Laughs.]
Aaaaaah!! Psst.
It's me.
I'm a horse.
[Music.]
[Laughing.]

****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e22 Episode Script ******
**** Made of Honor ****
Steven: This is just to give you some ideas.
Ruby said she wanted your reunion as Garnet to be special.
[Sighs.]
And there's nothing more special and romantic than a beautiful wedding.
It's like they say, if you wanna drink the cow, you gotta put a ring on it.
But, Sweetums, who says that? Let's take a look at printing styles for your
invitations.
Would it be cool if we got flames on it? Oh! And some dolphins.
Yeah! Dolphins and flames! I think I've got exactly what you're looking for on
page 135.
How long did it take you to put this together? My entire life.
This is gonna be the best wedding ever! This folding bone is so nice! Who knew
that planning a wedding could be so fun? I did! Time to sign.
Here you go, Peri.
Ugh! We've been stuffing these envelopes all day! How many does that make?
Liiii! That makes 10! Ohjust10.
Hmm.
[Birds squawking.]
[Humming.]
Hyuh! [Chuckles.]
[Humming.]
So, my dad will finish playing the music, and then, next, you'll do the "I do"s
and then I'll say, "I now pronounce you Garnet"! And then you fuse! Everyone'll
cheer! Everyonewho survived.
- Huh? - Oh, it's just there are so many old friends who won't be able to come.
All the Crystal Gems who are corrupted and bubbled in the basement.
Maybe we could bring the bubbles up here? No, no.
It's not safe.
We can't risk them getting out.
Hmm.
[Music.]
[Sighs.]
Ugh.
Uhh.
Hmm? I'm back? [Nervously.]
Hey, Bismuth.
Long time no see.
Rose.
I mean, Steven! Ohh, there's a third option now.
Well, why would you let me out? I just tried to shatter you.
You know how you fought Mom because her whole war strategy didn't make any
sense? Well, you were right! [Gasps.]
W-What's going on? Did Rose do this? Did she bubble everyone who disagreed with
her?! Huh? Oh, no! No! It's not like that.
Tigers Eye! [Gasps.]
Little Larimar! Beryl, Serpentine, and, ohh, Biggs! Biggs was beloved by
everyone! Bismuth, wait! I got ya, buddy.
Bismuth! You don't understand! Come on, Biggs, help me free the othe Biggs?
[Roaring.]
Bismuth! [Grunting.]
I'm sorry, Bismuth! This is not the Biggs you knew before.
- Steven - I know we had our differences, but so much has changed, and I just
wanted to tell you [Grunting.]
Aah! Ah! Bismuth! Biggs.
[Grunting.]
[Grunting.]
Only a Diamond could do damage like this.
It was Pink, wasn't it? And why didn't Rose stop her?! Because they were the
same person.
What? And that's the whole story.
Hmm.
Uh, are you okay? Mm.
Yeah.
Hang on a sec.
Uh, Bismuth? [Muffled screaming.]
Oh, my gosh! It all makes sense now! Pretty wild, right? [Sighs.]
Oh, that's nice.
Steven, come here and join me.
The lava's great.
I would, but I'm not lava proof.
[Chuckles.]
Eesh.
I was so excited to show Rose the Breaking Point.
Can you imagine? "Hey, Rose! Check out this cool weapon I made! I'm gonna
shatter you with it!" [Laughs.]
[Sighs.]
I really thought all of our problems would disappear if we could just shatter a
Diamond.
Guess she ended up taking my advice.
Um, sorry about all this.
[Sighs.]
Thanksfor talking to me.
Wow, you took that pretty well.
Way better than Garnet did.
- How so? - She unfused over it.
What?! Noooo! They're my favorite couple! Don't worry, they're back together, -
but they haven't fused yet.
- Huh? That's actually why I came down here to begin with.
I wanted to invite you to Garnet's wedding! Garnet's wedding, huh? Yeah.
It would be great if you could attend.
Yeahokay.
I don't have any plans, so I guess I can come.
Yay! This is gonna be so much fun! Pfft! Oh, yeah.
No question this is gonna be the best wedding ever! Pfft! [Chuckles.]
So, what's a wedding? Okay, so we're getting everything ready for tomorrow.
We'll have a hot dog grill going on out front, and the chairs and canopy are
all set up.
Probably should head out there and say hi.
Uh, Steven? I don't wanna ruin the surprise.
What surprise? You! They don't know I'm coming? Wait.
I can't do this.
You're right, you gotta have a gift.
We have a wedding registry.
Do you wanna pick something fromhere? What? No.
I mean [Sighs.]
What am I gonna say to 'em? You could do one of your signature catch phrases.
Like "Let's get down to Bismuth!" [business.]
Or, "Anybody wanna start a small Bismuth?" [business.]
Oh, oh! How about "Did you Bis-muth me?" [miss.]
[Twinkle!.]
Anyway, it's not gonna matter what you say.
They'll be so glad you're here.
Just be ready for my signal.
Ahh, this is gonna be great! They're gonna want you to be maid of honor.
[Door creaks open.]
A-Attention, everyone.
Please gather 'round.
[Clears throat.]
I'd like to propose a toast to Ruby and Sapphire! Now, we all know you guys
have been runnin' a little [Chuckles.]
hot and cold lately.
[Laughter.]
We are all excited to see you two fuse back together and achieve lifelong,
room-temperature happiness.
All of us, includiiiing Pearl! Pearl! Pearl! Pearl! Mm-hmm.
Yes.
And Pearl.
All of us, including Uh, Steven, can I drink this or what? I'll be right back.
And make sure those cans don't drop.
Bismuth.
Didn't you see my signal? [Music.]
Bismuth? Oh, there you are.
What happened out there? I-I'm sure if we hurry back, we can still surprise
them.
They're gonna be so happy to see you.
If they wanted to see me so much, they coulda let me out themselves, but they
didn't.
Of course they didn't.
I attacked their leader.
They're not gonna side with Rose anymore.
Not after I'm not talking about Rose.
I'm talking about you! But I'm not the leader.
Garnet's the leader.
And where's Garnet? She'll be back.
That's the whole point.
It's a big Crystal Gem wedding.
We should all be there together.
Why?! Why are the Crystal Gems still together after finding out that everything
was a sham?! Somebody's making them believe in the future, and it's you! You
seriously think they're gonna want me around when the last thing I did was try
to shatter you?! You told them everything, and they made their choice.
They want me in a bubble, and you out there.
But, Bismuth You say they want me to be made of honor? Well, I am.
I'm made of the most solid, flexible, diamagnetic stuff there is, and I'm not
as dense as you might think.
I've got enough self-respect in this Gem to accept that they don't want me on
their team anymore.
[Scoffs.]
I blew it.
Everything was different, and I didn't believe it.
Everything is different! We had a fight, so we can make up, right? If they
didn't let you out because they care about me, then they're gonna care that I
want you back on the team! Huh? I want you back on the team.
Forget the surprise.
If we show up together, they're all gonna know that everything's okay.
[Chuckles.]
Spoken like a leader.
No.
Spoken like a friend.
[Zap!.]
Hey, everyone! Did you guys Bis-muth me? [miss.]
Ha! I win! Also, less importantly, who are you? I invited Bismuth! I hope
that's cool.
Bismuth! [Chuckling.]
Whoa! Sapphire! - Bismuth! - Bismuth! [Laughs.]
You wouldn't believe what we've all been through.
I'm so sorry.
We should've Look, I'm right there with you.
Steven filled me in.
[Chuckles.]
So, is anyone gonna introduce me? Let's give 'em some space.
Oh, Ruby! Sapphire! I heard you're supposed to bring gifts to these things
[Music.]
[Gasps.]
And these aren't weapons, but Steven seemed to think they'd come in handy.
We love them!

**** Reunited (part1, part 2) ****
1 - Garnet: We - Are the Crystal - Steven: Gems - we'll always save the day
Steven: and if you think we can't All: we'll always find a way - that's why the
people - of this world Garnet: believe in Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl Steven:
And Steven! Mom was a Diamond who invaded Earth [Music.]
Saw its beauty and its worth Mom made an army And she fought herself Did that
even end up mattering When she faked her own shattering? Mom lived in hiding by
the name of Rose With the friends she'd made And the form she chose Now all
that's left of her exists in me And I think that we can all agree That is a
little bit upsetting I'd rather think about A wedding Let's think about cake
Let's think about flowers Let's think about dressing up and dancing around for
hours There's an awful lot of awful things We could be thinking of But for just
one day, let's only think about love Okay, Sapphire, I gotta get dressed for
our big day now, so no peeking! - And no future vision, either! - Sapphire:
[Giggles.]
Okay! Oh, Steven, I just wish I could have said something sooner about Rose and
Pink We could think about lies that we told in the past - They took it so hard.
- Think about hurt feelings - And how long they can last - How can we move on?
- Or we could think about hope - Hope? - You know I've been hopin' - About
what? That everything's better now, everything's out in the open Bismuth! Is
that what you're wearing to the wedding? - It's the nicest thing I own! -
Lookin' sharp! We could think about flowers We could think about cake We could
think about wonderful promises We have the power to make There's an awful lot
of awful things We could be thinking of But for just one day, let's only think
about love Maybe I shouldn't have picked up roses.
Might be a little controversial.
We could all rethink How we feel about Rose When it comes to Pink and the
things that she did - In the past, I suppose - Yeah.
Or we could both feel better 'Cause we could think about how We could think
about us, and we could think about now Well, if we don't use these, we're gonna
need something else.
No worries! Peridot's gathering more flowers right now.
I'll go get her! [Humming.]
But for just one day Let's only think about - Peridot? - What if Lapis was
right? Sooner or later, the Diamonds are going to come for the Cluster.
We're all gonna die here! We could think about war We could think about
fighting We could think about long-lost friends We wish we were inviting We
could think about the broken gems In the Cluster at the planet's core Or we
could think about the bubble we made So that they can't be hurt any They can't
be hurt anymore We could think about joy We could think about pain We could
think about sunshine We could think about rain There's an awful lot of awful
things We could be thinking of But for just one day Let's only think about All:
Just one day, let's only think about Just one day, let's only think about Lo-o-
o-ve [Guitar plays.]
- You nervous? - I'm not! [Guitar continues.]
Flowers for you! Flowers for you! Flowers for you! Wedding commander, all
flowers have been deployed! Thanks, Peridot.
[Guitar continues.]
[Seagulls crying.]
[Music.]
[Guitar quickens.]
[Clears throat.]
Dearly beloved Gems, Humans, lions big and small living gourds, Onion we are
gathered here today to celebrate Ruby and Sapphire, two of my favorite people
who combine into one of my other favorite people.
You all probably know her as Garnet.
She is their love, given form.
But now it's your turn to talk about that.
I know this is all kind of silly.
I mean, we've been together for 5,750 years! And eight months! I used to feel
like I wasn't much good, just one of me on my own.
But when we're together, it feels like it's okay to just be me.
So I want to be me with you! And and not even the Diamonds will come between
us! And if they try, we'll beat 'em up! [Laughs.]
Ruby, my future used to look like one single, obvious stream, unbending till
the end of time.
In an instant, you pulled me from that destiny and opened my eye to an
explosion of infinite possible futures, streaking across space and time,
altered and obliterated by the smallest force of will.
What I mean is, you changed my life.
And then, I changed your life.
And now, we change our lives.
- Bismuth, the rings! - Hey, Bismuth, that's your cue! [Sobbing.]
[Music.]
Ruby, do you take this gem to have and to hold, on this and every other planet
in the Universe? I do! - And, Sapphire, do you - Yes.
- You didn't let me finish! - I'm just very excited.
Then, by the power vested in me by the State of Delmarva, I now pronounce you
Garnet! [Music.]
[Cheers and applause.]
[Music.]
- Steven! - Hey, Garnet.
- Thanks for everything.
- Thanks for everything.
[Both laugh.]
- I needed this.
- I needed this.
[Both laugh.]
What a wonderful idea.
Humans find a way to make a moment's decision last forever.
I don't need future vision to know I'll always remember this.
I'm so glad.
Aw, no.
I'm sorry.
Don't cry.
I guess seeing everyone together has got me really choked up.
Wait a second.
You don't think - Blue Diamond.
- She's here?! And she's not alone! [Music.]
[All gasp.]
Oh, no.
It's the Diamonds! [All screaming.]
Nanefua, get on your Nanephone! We've got a code blue and a code yellow! This
is it! - We're over here, you clods! - Wha?! Where are they going?! If they're
not here for us, they must be here for the Cluster! - Whoa! [Rumbling.]
- What's the Cluster?! It's a huge earth-destroying geo-weapon that the
Diamonds made out of a bajillion gem shards! I gotta keep it calm and in its
bubble! I can use my mind to connect with it, - but only when I'm asleep.
- Asleep? [Rumbling.]
It's no use! How am I supposed to sleep through this? - Maybe a lullaby will
help.
- Uh, I'm not sure this is gonna [Snoring.]
[Indistinct whispering.]
[Music.]
[Gasps.]
The Cluster! Stay calm.
Try to keep from forming.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Nooo! It popped! [Rumbling.]
[Music.]
[Music.]
[Alarm blaring.]
[Over PA.]
Attention citizens of Beach City Everyone head to your designated shelters.
I repeat this is not a drill.
Get yourselves over to the shelters! [Music.]
All right! Looks like it's in control of itself, and it's on our side! [Music.]
Go, Cluster, go! [Rumbling music.]
[Music.]
[Splash.]
Blue Diamond.
Guess it's time to work the old Universe charm.
All: No! All right, I'll just be in here.
Rose Quartz so you escaped Homeworld and crawled back here.
This is Pink's world! How dare you use it as your hiding place?! Come! Answer
for what you've done! This is bad, this is bad, this is bad, this is bad! Come
on, you rocks, let's put her in a bubble! - Right! - Right! Wait! There's no
reason to fight.
Let me talk to her.
Blue Diamond, please listen to me! I didn't shatter Pink Diamond.
Pink Diamond's right here! It's pretty interesting when you think about it -
Enough! - Aah! Ugh! [Roars.]
Wait! You cannot fathom how much I've mourned, what thousands of years of grief
has done to me! [All grunt.]
What's going on!? Guys?! [Crying.]
[Whistles.]
[Lion growls.]
Hold on, guys! Connie! Aah! [Grunts.]
I know this sword.
This is the sword that shattered her! [Gasps.]
Aah! [People crying.]
- You deserve this all of you! - Stop, please! - Steven! - What do we do?! I
don't know.
She won't listen, she just wants to fight.
Garnet: Blue Diamond! Who are you supposed to be? I am the will of two gems to
care for each other, [Music.]
to protect each other from any threat, no matter how vast or how cruel.
You couldn't stop me 5,750 years ago, and you can't stop me now! It's you that
Ruby and Sapphire that disrupted my court.
Ugh! This is supposed to be my day! You hope to defeat me by clinging to my
feet? I just needed to keep you from taking three steps to the right.
[Dropping water.]
[Music.]
What?! - Whoo - Lapis?! [Breathing heavily.]
- You're really here.
- Hey.
Lapis! You came back again! I couldn't stay away.
If they're gonna punish me like a crystal gem, I might as well be one, right? -
You got room for one more? - Of course! Save the hugs for after the fight.
Look alive! Rah! Lapis Lazuli! Does every gem that comes in contact with this
planet turn traitor?! What? I've felt worse.
- Knock her off this beach! - Now's our chance! [Music.]
[Grunting.]
With all our strength together, we can take her down! That's right! This is our
home our planet our friends and family! We are the Crystal Gems! Pathetic! You
are nothing! [Firing.]
[Music.]
[Music.]
[Roars.]
[Music.]
[Grunting.]
Wah-ahh! Hey, Blue Diamond, fight me! You got guts, tiny! Let me give you a
hand! Whaaa! Everyone, group up! [Music.]
Yeah! [Music.]
[Electricity zapping.]
Uh, guys? Run for it! Aah! - The house! - Don't worry, I can fix it! - My dad!
- Uh-oh All right, I'm stickin' with you guys! [Thud.]
- Hup! - Did we do it? [All gasp.]
Cluster, you were amazing! Are you okay? Do you want to go back in your bubble?
Okay, take it easy! You're the best.
So, that is a wedding reception.
Hmm.
Nice job, wedding planner.
- Did ya see that?! - She couldn't lay a finger on me! Hmm, but did you notice
how I perfectly managed my trajectory right into her eyes?! I'll demonstrate!
Launch me again! [Chuckles.]
I like you, Peridot.
You don't quit.
[Clanging.]
[Music.]
[Music.]
Ha! I told her off once.
I can do it again! Hey, yellow clod! - Remember me?! - No.
Stop! Don't do this!! Listen to me I'm the one you're missing! - I'm Pink
Diamond! - You! Aah! Steven! - Steven: Huh? - Steven?! Steven: Connie, what's
wrong?! Come on, please wake up! I'm up, I'm up! What's going on?! - Connie,
I'm right here! - Come on, Steven, we need you! Aah! What the hoo-hah?! Huh.
Well, this is new.
What is this place? [Music.]
What else have you got?! I've only just begun to fight! Aah! [Gasps.]
Lapis! [Music.]
- Connie, are you seeing this?! - Wake up! Please! We're supposed to be in this
together, remember? - Uh, Connie, I'm o-kay? - Huh? Steven?! - Huh? - Connie,
it's me! W-Where are you? How are you doing I'm not sure, but I think it's a
classic psychic ghost-type situation! Ah, of course.
So, what's the plan? The Diamonds won't listen to me out there, but maybe I can
get through to them here.
They've gotta know Pink Diamond wasn't shattered.
Please protect my body while I'm gone.
Got it! Good luck out there, Steven.
[Music.]
This is it, I've got to hold it together.
I've gotta hold everyone together.
You can do it, Garnet! Remember, you're made of love! Steven? Huh.
Always full of surprises.
[Grunting.]
Amethyst: Don't get shattered, don't get shattered, don't get shattered! You
can do this, Amethyst! I believe in you! Steven? I can do this! I can do this!
I can do this! Pearl: I won't give up! Everything I do, I do it for her! I do
it for him! Don't forget about yourself, Pearl! I do it for me! I just got my
friends back, and now I'm gonna lose em again? We can still do this together!
What am I thinking! We haven't lost yet! Hang in there, Peridot.
You, too, Lapis! [Grunts.]
[Music.]
How miserable.
I knew Pink couldn't handle her own colony, but I gave in.
And now I'm to blame for her fate.
Aah! Her thoughts are too strong! What good will any of this do? The more I
make these gems suffer, the more I long to see you again, Pink.
Huh? [Music.]
Almost! Blue Diamond, please listen! Whoa, whoa! - What the? - I felt something
someone.
It worked! I gotta get through to them! Ahh! Pink isn't gone! I can explain
everything - if you just stop this fighting! Aah! - There it is again! - What
are you jabbering about? - A presence! It feels like Please, Blue, you're being
hysterical, more so than usual.
Listen, Yellow, Pink's fate is different than you think! She faked her
shattering! - This feeling, I know it! - It must be a trick! Show yourself,
foe! I'm not your foe! Please just listen to me! - There! Aah.
- Aah! [Warbling.]
[Music.]
Steven: Please, the fighting has to stop.
We aren't enemies, we're family.
Please, listen to me! I need you to know who I am! - Impossible! - This aura
[Music.]
[Gasps.]
It's you! Pink! [Music.]
I always thought I might be bad Now I'm sure that it's true 'Cause I think
you're so good

1 - Garnet: We - Are the Crystal - Steven: Gems - we'll always save the day
Steven: and if you think we can't All: we'll always find a way - that's why the
people - of this world Garnet: believe in Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl Steven:
And Steven! Agh! Ohh, Pink! I can't believe it! You've been here all along.
Ohh.
[Sobs.]
[Groaning.]
Ohh! We can't just hand Steven over to Blue Diamond.
She's a shatterer! [Sniffles.]
She's not gonna hurt him.
Look at her.
[Sobs, laughs.]
She really thinks he's one of them.
[Sobs loudly.]
Somebody make Blue Diamond stop! Are you guys okay? It's just [Sniffles.]
Blue Diamond's power.
She's obviously relieved that Pink Diamond wasn't shattered after all.
[Straining.]
Hm! How could you do this to us, Pink? Why did you let us think you were
shattered? Why the strange disguise? Why are you doing a voice? Why didn't you
say something at the trial?! And, Blue, can you please stop crying? I can't
see.
[Splash!.]
Sorry.
My mom kept it secret from everyone.
A-hem! Almost everyone.
What are you talking about? Well, apparently, Mom Oh, geez.
You don't know what a mom is.
Okay.
Pink Diamond took the form of Rose Quartz permanently after faking her shatter.
Then Rose Quartz gave up that form to create a new life with my dad me.
Rose passed her gemstone and some of her powers on to me, but that's all.
I I don't have any of Pink or Rose's memories.
I'm sorry.
[Whoosh!.]
Hmm.
I'm sure your memories - are in there somewhere, Pink.
- Actually I go by "Steven.
" Oh, stars! How did you even survive? We blasted the planet and obliterated
every gem on its surface.
They weren't exactly obliterated.
[Gargling.]
[Shrieks.]
[Chomping.]
What am I looking at? [Screeches.]
No one should have survived our attack.
Centipeedle's mind is broken.
I've tried to heal her, but it didn't stick.
Heal her? But maybe you two can help her! You're so much stronger than me.
And I got close.
Well, that's not something we normally do.
This is completely unprecedented! But you did this to her.
You have to help her.
All of them.
Hmm.
Very well.
I can try.
But I make no promises.
[Electricity buzzing.]
[Screeches.]
[Whirring.]
[Electricity pulsating.]
There.
Good as new.
Aaagg! Crhhhrrr! She may be too far gone.
Gently, Yellow.
[Whooshing.]
[Screeches.]
There we are.
No! Please, no! No, no.
We're all gonna be No! Please, no! No, no.
We're all gonna be - Centi? - No! Please, no! No, no.
We're all gonna be No! Please.
Centi.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Nephrite.
Facet 413 Cavishon 12.
- Wh-a-a-at?! - Unbelievable.
I'm sorry for my failure to heed my Hessonite's evacuation orders.
My team and I tried our best to make it out before the attack.
But But you're here.
It must have worked! You finally avenged Pink Diamond! You destroyed Rose
Quartz! [Screeching.]
Oh, Pink.
How many perfectly adequate gems did you have us ruin? Shhh.
Yellow.
Pink's been punished enough.
She's been trapped here on this awful planet with these creatures.
Do it again! It was working! How long do you expect us to hold her together? I-
I don't know.
Forever! You did this, so you have to do something! We can only do so much.
If it was the four of us Oh, no.
We can't let her see this.
Who?! Who do we need?! What do you mean, who? White! - White Diamond? - What?!
Steven, White Diamond isn't like us.
She isn't even like them.
You have no idea what she's capable of.
I just want to talk.
Blue: I don't think you'll have much luck with that.
White hasn't left Homeworld in eons.
Then we're going to Homeworld! In what? You and your "friends" destroyed both
our ships! Unless You don't still have yours, do you? Steven: This place is
filled with Mom's junk, so there's a good chance it's buried around here.
We can split up the area like a grid and divide the search.
It's just past these pink pyramids! We've got a lot of desert to cover.
It may take a while and be really super-hot, but if we don't give up, I know we
can find it! [Electricity hums.]
Uh, Steven? [Gasps.]
[Rumbling.]
Steven: Ohh.
[Chuckles nervously.]
[Music.]
You're going to do great.
Are you sure you have everything? Food, water.
Where's your sword? I can't believe I'm saying that.
It's okay, Mom.
This is going to be a diplomatic mission.
And I'll be with her the whole time.
I know the planet.
There's an atmosphere.
She'll be able to breathe.
[Tinkle!.]
All right.
Be careful.
Just come home safe.
Aww.
Thanks, Mom! Thanks, Dad! I can't believe I'm finally going to Homeworld! There
might be more Famethysts! Love you, Shtu-ball.
Be careful out there.
I love you, too.
I'll be back before you know it.
Lion.
Bring it in, buddy.
Garnet, should I be worried? Steven will be fine.
If you could water this for me while I'm gone, it'd be a big help.
Oh, uh, sure thing.
Don't miss me too much.
[Chuckles.]
Hmm? Bismuth, are you ready? I [Whirring.]
I'm not gonna join a diamond entourage! I know what you're doing.
I get why you gotta do it.
But I'm not gonna lay my gem on their anvil.
Anvil? Okay.
Let me put this in Earth terms for you.
You're about to enter the lion's den.
Luckily, you're a lion, too! You gotta roar at them in their language! You're
the one that has to do it.
Right.
Besides, you're gonna need me at the home base.
Someone's gotta keep an eye on these two while you're gone.
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.
Hm.
Okay! Let's go to Homeworld! - Yeah! - Yeah! [Sarcastically.]
Fantastic.
[Whirring.]
It's a good look for you, Steven.
Thank you.
Oh, it's been so long since we've been together in Pink's ship.
[Sobs.]
Please, Blue.
If we could continue? [Sniffles.]
Yes.
Of course.
[Sniffles.]
For launching, just get a running start.
Hm! [Music.]
You got this, Steven! Hold on! I'm taking off! [Music.]
I'll bet when Mom took off, it was pretty graceful, huh? No.
Not really.
S-Should I have brought a gift for White Diamond? We are dropping in
unexpectedly, and I-I want to make a good first impression.
Her help will mean everything for the corrupted gems.
- Steven.
- Hmf! Good impression? We'll be lucky if she ever speaks to us again after
this.
- But - The thing is White can be difficult.
When we show up in this ship, it will be irrefutable that the last 6,000 years
are now the biggest galactic embarrassment that's ever happened.
And we're the ones to blame.
If you don't want to be in a bubble for the next few millennia, I suggest you
let me do the talking.
[Clears throat.]
We're here.
[Whirring.]
[Yawns.]
Really? Ugh! Whatgives? [Whirring.]
Steven: Homeworld.
[Music.]
Everyone, wait here.
Blue and I will return for you once White's temper has cooled.
Which might take a while.
- But - Wait.
That sound.
[Indistinct cheering.]
[Cheering continues.]
Whoa! Maybe things won't be so bad.
[Cheering stops abruptly.]
[Whirring.]
[Gasps.]
It's White's Pearl.
Pink Diamond, your presence is required.
Come on, Blue.
Only Pink Diamond's presence is necessary.
Uh, maybe we could [Gasps.]
- Wait! Steven! - Steven! [Gasps.]
White: Pink! There you are.
Hello, Starlight.
You certainly gave everyone a scare.
They're all just thrilled to see you safe and sound.
Um, hi? I As for this latest little game of yours, thank the stars it's over.
Did you have fun? Did you get everything out of your system? - I - Good, good.
Everyone is so relieved.
Welcome home, Pink.
[Music.]
Wh Wait! Hold on! I always thought I might be bad Now I'm sure that it's true
'Cause I think you're so good And I'm nothing like you

1 Hello? Must be Pink's room? I need a bed.
What?! [Gasps.]
Go, go, go! Go! Well, I need a place to sit! Oh! Oh, oh! Hmm.
I need a shelf for my face, face, face, face, face.
Eh.
Hey! Who the heck are you little guys? [Pebbles whimpering.]
Thank you! "Thank you"? - Is it - It is her! [Laughter.]
- Why does she look different? - She's back! It's time! It's time! Oh, Diamond
Pink, Pink! Aagh! Don't don't build stuff in my mouth.
[Laughs.]
All right, who are you guys? - Very funny, Pink! - Always playing her games.
Pretending she doesn't know us pebbles.
- Pearl! - Steven! Oh, thank the stars! You're okay! What did White Diamond do?
Did she hurt you?! No, she was like, "Welcome home.
" I don't think she understands that I'm not Pink Diamond.
Where's Connie? And Garnet and Amethyst? They're still on the ship.
I'm only here because I'm bringing your things.
And they consider me one of your things.
Yeesh.
The Diamond chime it's Yellow! Pink Diamond, my Diamond has requested your
presence in the extraction chamber.
Let's get you into a suit.
Swim trunks don't seem very formal.
Trust me, this will be more comfortable than jeans.
[Indistinct whispering.]
Hello! - Pink Diamond.
- Please, call me Steven.
- Pink Steven.
- No, just Steven.
Just Steven.
Call me lasagna.
Steven, stop, you're going to break her.
Have a nice extraction, Pink Lasagna.
- Pink.
- Hi, Yellow.
Cool sauna.
It's new.
Have a seat.
Oop! So, you met with White.
How was it? All I got to say was, "Hi," and, "um," and, "I.
" Two and a half words that's a record.
Two and a half words isn't enough.
I still need to talk to White about healing - all the corrupted gems! - Hmm.
Good luck.
White never leaves her own head these days, and she never lets anyone in except
you, I guess.
It's so unfair.
I have hundreds of successful crystal system colonies, but you get to see her
because your one colony is a failure! Maybe you should just fail? [Laughs.]
Oh, Pink, you always did have quite a knack for making me laugh.
You're almost worth the trouble.
Ugh.
Already? Excuse me.
[Whooshing.]
I've got to check on the latest Citrine production reports.
What should I do about White? I still need to talk to her about helping the
corrupted gems.
Pink Diamond, my Diamond has requested your presence.
Steven: We barely talked about White at all.
She had to rush to do a report, and I couldn't go with her.
I get they're, like, busy, 'cause they're dictators and everything but I need
more time! I should have asked her what she was doing - after the Citron thing!
- She'll be at that for a while.
Yellow Diamond oversees all aspects of gem production on every single one of
her colonies.
And when she's not doing that, she's off with her army, conquering the next
one.
What about their days off, weekends? My Diamond is awaiting our arrival.
[Air hisses.]
Blue Diamond is just up the stairs.
- I'll wait for you here.
- I'll be back in a bit! Welcome back.
Comby: You'll never be alone-y As long as you are combing [Sighs.]
You're here! Come in! Okay.
Whoo-hoo! [Laughs.]
It's funny.
I I live right next to the ocean, but I end up going to space to swim.
[Laughs.]
[Rumbling.]
You haven't changed.
So silly.
So small.
I'm not done growing.
I'm not sure I can catch up to you and Yellow, though.
I'm so glad you're back Steven.
- Y-you actually said my name! - Steven.
Steee-von.
[Chuckles.]
It's such a funny sounding name.
You're so creative, Pink! Remember when I let you name that batch of pyrite
"fool's gold"? [Laughs.]
White was furious! I'm sorry.
I don't remember.
Oh.
Do you remember the game we used to play here? We had such fun together you and
I and Yellow and White.
We were all together here?! You would stand under water, all the way at the
bottom, and sing.
And we would be above the surface trying to guess the song.
Can we do that right now? Maybe after, we can talk White into coming back to
Earth with us.
No.
We stopped coming here together after you left.
That was the start of Era 2.
No one wanted to be here not with your empty spot.
It was so quiet.
I know you guys have colony stuff to do, but we should spend more time
together.
Blue Pearl: [Clears throat.]
My apologies, my Diamond, but your next appointment.
- Of course.
- Wait! I wanted to talk to you about White.
- Later, perhaps.
- Aah! - Pearl? - Steven? - Some water got up my nose.
- Oh, dear.
[Sighs.]
This is so weird.
Was this some sort of spa day or something? And what about Pink? Did she have a
job here, or did she just sit in her room while they were off doing whatever?
Before her colony, Pink used to throw massive balls.
She was a juggler?! No Well, yes.
But she would also throw parties for the other Diamonds, to mark their many
accomplishments.
Every member of every court would show up to bask in the presence of all four
Diamonds.
Even White would come? Oh, yes! Huh.
I wonder what's even become of Pink's court.
That reminds me.
Hang tight.
I'll be back.
Where would I evengo? What did I get myself into? [Pebbles chattering.]
Am I just supposed to be Pink Diamond now? Hey, pebbles, can you help me? Who
was she? What did she do? And why does this feel so - Oh.
- Ooh! Familiar Why is this so familiar? Familiar Like something I used to know
Used to know Familiar Staring up at the ceiling Familiar I swear that I know
this feeling Where everybody wants me to be Mom - Wants me to be Mom - Wants me
to be Mom And everything I do, I do it wrong I do, I do it wrong I'll sway them
with a joke or with a song Or with a song And maybe that'll help us get along
Familiar Why is this so familiar? Familiar Like something I used to do Used to
do Familiar Did she used to throw a tantrum? Insisting "But hey, I'm a Diamond,
too!" I bet she drove them crazy all the time Crazy all the time They love her,
but they're leaving her behind With more important places they should be Places
they should be Than hanging out with someone just like me Familiar That's why
it's so familiar That's why it's Familiar Like someone I used to be Someone I
used to be Familiar But this time, I've had some practice This time I've had At
helping a struggling family A struggling family Oh, I'll get them all together
in one place And once we're all together face to face I'll show them all the
error of their ways And end their spread of terror across space Steven! I'm
back with Hi, Pearl.
I just thought I'd, uh, dress for the occasion.
Well you're not the only one with surprises.
Guys! Mmm! I figured it out! Remember back when I was little and maybe kind of
annoying, and I couldn't come along on adventures? You guys would still drop
everything to hang out with me! That's Pink Diamond! I know I can do this! Just
watch I'm gonna throw a huge ball, and I'm gonna invite everyone! Look at you
go I just adore you I wish that I knew What makes you think I'm so special?

****** Steven Universe (2013) s05e27 Episode Script ******
**** Together Alone ****
1 - Garnet: We - Are the Crystal - Steven: Gems - we'll always save the day
Steven: and if you think we can't All: we'll always find a way - that's why the
people - of this world Garnet: believe in Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl Steven:
And Steven! [Whimsical orchestral music.]
[Dramatic music.]
[Whimsical music resumes.]
[Both laugh.]
[Coughing.]
[Pink Pearl's laughter echoes.]
[Suspenseful music.]
[Coughing.]
Blegh! [Gasps.]
- Steven, are you okay? - Yeah Just had a really weird nightmare.
Pink's moving again! Oh, hey.
Good morning.
Amethyst: It's something with four legs and a lot of cushions on top.
The pebbles have been working all night.
What do you think? - It almost feels like home.
- Almost.
A ball? We haven't had a ball in 6,000 years.
We haven't had Pink in 6,000 years.
Steven: Yeah.
When White shows up, we can tell her why we need her help on Earth.
And this could also mark the beginning of era three.
You're right.
It's brilliant.
Thank you, Yellow! Thank you, Blue! If White is gonna be there, everything has
to be perfect.
Pink, can you manage this on your own? Our pearls can help you get started.
At your service, Pink Diamond.
Make sure you go over all of our customs with Pink since she has so much
trouble recalling her past - here on Homeworld.
- Yes, my diamond.
Era three? Steven, you're already changing the world.
[Chuckling.]
Yeah.
Come on, party pearls! Pearls: We are at your command, Pink Diamond.
Just call me Steven.
Whatever you command, Pink Diamond.
Steven: Balloons everywhere.
Confetti cannons, too.
Dibs on being the confetti cannon.
Cannons are forbidden inside palace walls.
These balloons you're referring to are unprecedented and therefore out of the
question.
So, what is precedented and therefore, in the question? You are to sit on your
elevated throne while the members of your court indicate to you that they are
present.
Yikes.
That sounds pretty dry.
- Liquids are forbidden in the ballroom.
- All right.
From here, you can accept or reject the members of your court at your leisure.
My diamond will do the same, as will Blue Diamond.
And if we are so lucky, all of us will enjoy the impeccable judgement of White
Diamond.
So, when she gets here, I'll just hop up there and talk to her? Oh, stars, no!
I forgot how silly you can be.
- Everyone stays where they belong.
- Oh.
So I-I'll just wait till I get a chance to talk to her - on the dance floor.
- Pink Diamond! Your subjects will do the dancing for you.
Why would a diamond want to dance? - 'Cause dancing's fun.
- What is, "ffffun"? You know, it's when you do something you want to do, just
because it feels good.
I don't think we do that here.
Well, is there something you really like to do? Oh.
Of course not.
My feelings are irrelevant.
- I like to draw.
- W-What?! - Can I see some of your stuff? - Um here.
My diamond allows me to draw during court proceedings.
They're nothing much.
Let me see that.
You can't share these.
They're highly confidential.
Hmm.
Not bad.
Try a different angle.
[Laughs.]
That's it.
You like being a model, and you like being an artist.
[Pearls laughing.]
- Blue Diamond: Pink? - [Gasps.]
Why aren't you getting ready? I guess I am ready if all I have to do is sit in
a chair.
Are you really going to look like this? - Even at the ball? - I can't really
help it.
You aren't thinking of inviting your Earth friends, are you? Why wouldn't I?
All: Steven! [Grunts.]
They can't come? Aren't they my court or whatever? Pink, quit fooling around!
White Diamond is going to be there.
We have to present her with our best possible selves, just as our gems have to
present us with their best possible selves.
A ball is a chance to inspire everyone.
But my friends are super inspiring.
They'll inspire White, too.
Together, we can make a case for Earth.
Very well.
You can bring your pearl, of course, and your pet.
- Uh, pet? - I think she means me.
Blue Diamond: As for this faulty amethyst Oh, boy.
Here it comes.
she'll need limb enhancers to meet her height requirements.
The sapphire will need to enter with the other sapphires, of course, and the
ruby will need to enter with the guard.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
A-Are you talking about Garnet? Garnet? Does that call herself a garnet? -
[Laughs.]
- What would you have her do? Enter with the Demantoids? The Hessonites? The
Pyropes? Pink, I'm being very generous, but you can't expect me to - I won't
go.
- Garnet.
At least the sapphire in there has some sense.
[Growls.]
[Sighs.]
Pink, are you going to ring in the ball? - What? - Oh, I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of everything.
Come, Pearl.
- Garnet - I'll find you when it's over.
I thought we'd get to do this together.
Steven.
This is your chance to talk to White.
She's not gonna listen to me, but she might listen to Pink.
Then she'll listen when I tell her about you.
Once I talk to White Diamond, I'll change everything.
I promise.
[music.]
[Vocalizing.]
Jades: Pink Diamond! It's wonderful to be in your presence.
Uh, thank you.
Wow.
So radiant and sparkling.
Pink Diamond.
That's me, your ding dang diamond.
Wow.
So radiant and exquisite.
Steven, you're doing great.
White Diamond will be very impressed.
- Well, she better be.
- Yo! My Diamond! Amethyst! Is it okay if I say hi? We're starting soon, but if
you're quick about it - Thanks, Pearl.
- Steven.
- Huh? - Your manners.
Oh.
Right.
Amethyst, it is good to see you.
Good to see you, my diamond.
Sorry you have to wear those limb enhancers.
Not sure how Peridot put up with these things, but I'm getting used to it.
Yo, check out this cool party trick I taught myself.
Aha.
[Laughs.]
Amethyst, come on.
I know.
This is a serious party.
Anyway, I'm gonna go mingle with some, uh, quartzes.
Hi.
How's it going? [music.]
I really hope this works out, Connie.
[Gasps.]
Ruby and Sapphire are here.
When I told Garnet I still wanted her to come, I-I hope she didn't think I
meant I wanted her to split.
I'm sure she just wants to support you in any way she can.
Yellow Pearl: Everyone, behold.
The daunting beauty and elegance that is Yellow Diamond! [music.]
Not a bad turnout, Pink.
I appreciate your attendance, Yellow.
Blue Pearl: Ahem.
Everyone, prepare yourselves emotionally for the overpowering elegance that is
Blue Diamond.
[music.]
You're doing great.
Thank you, Blue.
Hmm.
To those in attendance of the era three ball [Drumroll.]
White Diamond has more important things to attend to.
- What?! - Therefore I will be here to observe in her place.
- Welcome to era three.
- Ugh! [Vocalizing.]
[Sighs.]
I made everyone do this, and it's somiserable.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Steven - Don't you mean Pink Diamond? Of course I don't.
Come on.
Do you want to dance? - Yeah, but I'm not supposed to.
- It's your party.
- But White expects me - She's not here.
[Grunts.]
[music.]
Everybody's staring.
Since when does that bother you? I'm sorry, everyone.
Uh Steven, we're gonna be okay.
I'm here.
Look at me.
We'll get through this together.
[Laughs.]
- [Laughs.]
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
[Laughs.]
- Pink, what are you doing? - I was just dancing.
[Gasps.]
[music.]
Pink, this is completely unacceptable.
Unfuse or I'll make you! - You'll have to go through me.
- [Gasps.]
And me.
Yeah.
And me.
I knew it.
I knew I couldn't be the only one.
Aah! - Opal! - Aah.
Garnet! Pink, you've gone too far, even for you.
- Stay in here and think about what you've done.
- No.
Wait!

**** Escapism ****
1 Aah! Ugh! Ah.
Hmm.
Not getting out that way.
Oh.
A window! Aah! Aah! - You okay? - Mm-hmm.
Well good thing I grabbed a couple of these before the ball.
Otherwise, we'd have nothing to eat.
Can't escape Gem Prison on an empty stomach.
We never should have come here.
What? This whole plan what was I even thinking? Well, you were thinking that if
you came to Homeworld and talked to White Diamond, maybe you could save all the
corrupted Gems on Earth.
Oh, right, and look where that got us.
Well, we knew it wouldn't be easy.
Yeah, but I didn't think I'd get every Crystal Gem poofed at the same time.
And what'll Dad say when he finds out? His only son, in jail at 14! What a
disgrace.
We can't give up.
One step at a time.
We'll think of something.
Okay, so, we tried the bubble and the shields and that window.
What else have we got? Uh hey, my phone.
Oh, wait.
No reception.
Not that there's anyone we could call for help anyway.
How long do you think they'll keep us locked up in here? 100 years? - That's
it! - Really?! 100 years?! No, call for help.
There's one Crystal Gem left that hasn't been poofed, and that's Bismuth.
Maybe I can reach her with my sleepy psychic mind powers.
You think you can do that, reach all the way to Earth with your mind? It'll be
a stretch for sure, but I won't know unless I try.
Well, what are we waiting for? Bedtime, mister.
All right.
Here goes nothing.
You can do this.
Whoa.
Connie, I did it.
I'm in that psychic ghost space again.
Great.
Can you talk to Earth? H-Hang on.
I got to find it first.
Okay.
Earth, where you at? Come on.
Beach City, video games, doughnuts, Dad.
There you are! - You find it? - Yeah, but it looks far away.
This might take me a while.
Okay.
I'll be here.
Good luck.
This is gonna take forever.
Maybe if I W-Whoa! Too fast! Too fast! Slow down! Aah! Raaaaaaaahh! Ugh! Huh?
Shhhhhh.
Ah! Hmm.
Shh, shh.
I guess I have to face That in this awful place I shouldn't show a trace of
doubt But pulled against the grain I feel a little pain That I would rather do
without I'd rather be Free Free Free I'd rather be Free Free Free Free Free
Free From here Guess we'll see what happens.
When I see the way you look Shaken by how long it took I can do about anything
I could even learn how to love

1 - Garnet: We - Are the Crystal - Steven: Gems - we'll always save the day
Steven: and if you think we can't All: we'll always find a way - that's why the
people - of this world Garnet: believe in Garnet - Amethyst - and Pearl Steven:
And Steven! [music.]
[Groans.]
Oh, right prison.
[Heavy footsteps approaching, door chimes.]
I cannot believe you! Making a scene like that.
We weren't trying to make a scene! We were just dancing ? Connie? What have you
done with Connie? What have I done? What have you done? You're the one that
wanted to keep those organics from the Kyanite colony.
- I'm just the fool that let you.
- What? Now your little pets are chasing the pearls up and down the halls.
What were you thinking letting them loose in the ballroom? They could be
anywhere.
- Bah! - Ah! Eee! Pink! [Mumbling.]
Ugh.
Please.
Just get rid of it.
[Mumbling continues.]
[Sighs.]
Pink White is very unhappy with you.
If this keeps up, she's going to take away your pearl.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Huh? [Echoing.]
Why do you always do this, Pink? Huh? [Indistinct whispering.]
[music.]
Huh?! [Gems clatter.]
[Energy rising.]
No, stop! [music.]
[Screaming.]
[Gasps, breathing heavily.]
Oh, Connie, you you're here.
[Yawns.]
Yeah.
Can't exactly leave [Heavy footsteps approaching, door chimes.]
I cannot believe you making a scene like that.
Whoa deja blue.
We didn't mean any harm.
I asked Steven to dance.
He wasn't trying to cause trouble.
What do you know about this, human? You think I've never been grounded before?
"Grounded"? Blue, you gotta let us out of here.
We're gonna starve.
"Starve"? What is this? Another made up problem? Another trick, so I'll cave
and let you out? Well, not this time.
You're not leaving this tower until you apologize for fusing at the ball.
- No.
- [Gasps.]
Steven.
What? I'm not sorry.
We finally have you back and you're worse than ever.
[Energy hums.]
Steven! It's fine, Connie.
I'm not even sad.
But you're really dehydrated! Blue, Connie and I fuse all the time.
It's totally normal and fine.
Agh! In what universe could that possibly be fine? This universe! The crystal
gems fuse all the time, too.
Blue, you gotta tell me where their gems are.
They didn't do anything wrong.
Oh! Pink! Your time on Earth has warped your sense of right and wrong.
Yeah, maybe it has.
Maybe Pink thought you guys were right to lock her in here when she messed
stuff up.
But I know what it's like to have a loving family, and we don't do stuff like
this to each other.
The crystal gems understand that I'm Steven, and they support me and Connie.
And you guys poofed 'em for sticking up for me.
That isn't normal.
That's enough! [Energy whirs.]
[Grunts.]
This isn't normal.
How many times did you lock her in here? How many times did you make her cry? I
didn't, I [Gasps.]
And I'm doing it again, aren't I? [music.]
And this is why you left, isn't it? [music.]
You were right to leave.
I always thought that you were failing this world.
But if you were happier on Earth, maybe this world was failing you.
We never should have brought you back here! Your "family," your "crystal gems"
are bubbled.
Let's get you all back in your legs and back home.
All right, it's safe.
[Food clatters.]
Steven and Connie: Food! [Both munching.]
[music.]
[Sighs.]
[Upbeat music.]
[music.]
Good-bye, Pebbles.
Wish us luck.
I'm ready.
We've got friends to save.
[music.]
[music.]
[Electricity hums.]
What are you doing? I'm taking back my friends! What are you doing, Blue? Take
Pink back to the tower.
She prefers to be called "Steven.
" [Crash.]
What are you talking about?! You can't keep bending the rules for her, Blue.
She has to set an example.
And we have to set an example.
If we bend the rules for her, we bend them for everyone.
Well, maybe you should.
Take them back to the tower, now! I won't.
Then I'll do it myself.
[Grunts.]
Blue?! [Gasps.]
[Grunts.]
Ugh! [Grunts.]
[music.]
Steven, now.
[Grunts.]
[Both grunt.]
[Orb chimes.]
When we thought Pink was shattered, when she abandoned us, I alone was there
for you.
And you would use your power against me?! [music.]
[Screaming.]
[Grunting.]
[Gems clatter.]
They're free.
Come on, guys.
You're not bubbled anymore.
- You can come out.
- Are they okay? [Heavy footsteps.]
You'd hurt a fellow diamond?! Didn't we hurt Pink? She was suffering in silence
for ages just like our gems, just like me! And I know you're suffering in
silence, too.
[Energy hums.]
[Groans.]
[Screaming.]
[music.]
Stop! [Grunts.]
[Clank.]
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
This is what White Diamond expects of all of us from a thin flake of mica to
the deepest, hardest stone we all must make sacrifices for the sake of our
perfect empire.
Does this look perfect to you? [Sizzling.]
My dad says if every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs.
And that means what? It means if you try to make this empire perfect, if you
just wipe away everything you see as flawed you lose all the things that make
you happy like hot dogs.
Or our Pink.
Uh [Crash.]
Stop.
Stop it, Blue.
Stop using your power on me.
I'm not! [Gasps.]
[Heavy footsteps.]
[music.]
Steven, come on.
Grab the gems.
Let's get out of here.
Right.
I hope they're okay.
Amethyst would usually be back by now.
They'll be out for a good while.
They took a direct hit from me.
Yellow, we've got to get them out of here before White finds out about any of
this.
Right.
Quickly.
Your legs are this way.
[Panting.]
Don't worry, guys.
I'll get you home safe.
Even if we have to escape now, we'll find some way to heal the corrupted gems.
We can come back to Homeworld.
W-we'll still have the legs.
I don't know.
I don't know if White will ever see us.
We're almost there.
Here we are.
Hurry, get inside.
[Energy building.]
[Twinkle!.]
You're not going anywhere.
[Rumbling.]
[music.]
[Both gasps.]
[music.]
[music.]
[Legs clanking.]
[music.]
You've made a grave mistake.
Go to your rooms! Uh Which rooms should we go to? Blue, don't make her any
angrier than she already is! We're busted.
Looks like this just turned into a face-off.
Amethyst, Pearl, Garnet? Please I think we're really in trouble.
[Ting!.]
What the heck is that?! [Objects whooshing.]
[music.]
Yellow, Blue did you have a hand in this? No way.
- White, that wasn't us! - We swear! Then who's that? Who cares! Knock her out!
[music.]
[music.]
Who's responsible for this? [Hand ships whirring.]
Gasp.
I always wanted to uppercut an upper crust! [Laughs.]
BOTH: Bismuth! - You came! - Heck yeah, we did.
- We? - Of course.
You thought we wouldn't be here at a time like this? Steven: Lapis Lazuli and
Peridot! [music.]
- That felt great.
- Wasn't that cool, Steven? Check out the awesome job we did fixing up those
hand ships.
Uh who needs thumbs? White Pearl: Very cute.
Glad to see we're having fun.
However, White Diamond has certain issues with your conduct that will need to
be addressed before we move forward.
Steven, quickly use one of our ships to get home.
- Huh? - Blue: Yes.
You have another chance.
Take my arm.
Fly to Earth.
Yellow and I will keep White distracted.
Blue, Yellow Don't worry, Steven.
We understand now.
This way of living it must've been like torture for you.
[Rumbling.]
Just go! Hurry! She's getting up! No.
No, I won't go.
Pink Diamond ran away from you.
Rose Quartz, my mom, she started a war with you.
But I don't want to run.
I don't want to fight.
I just want to talk.
We've come so far just to get White Diamond's attention, and now we finally
have it.
If we can fix our family, we can fix everything! But in order to fix it, we'd
have to admit that it's broken.
She'll never want to hear it.
But it's the truth! My mom back on Earth used to have so many rules for me to
follow.
It was so overwhelming, and it made me feel miserable.
After I told her how I was feeling, things got way better between us.
She even let me come out to space to help Steven.
If White knew how unhappy she's made you feel, maybe everything would change.
What do you say, Yellow? Do you think White might actually listen to us for a
change? It's worth a try.
Lend me a hand, will you, Blue? Okay.
[Hand ships engines turn over.]
- Huh? - The ships! [music.]
Steven, take a knee.
Okay.
White, please.
All we want you to do is listen! That's it, Steven.
Come on, Blue.
[Hand ship beeps, energy hums.]
[music.]
That's it.
Come on, everybody.
[music.]
[music.]
Hey, White, I know I was in there with you for a second, but I barely got to
talk to you at all.
There are so many gems that are hurting right now.
Even Blue and Yellow are hurting! You should hear what they have to say! [Gems
clink.]
Mmm.
This is it! [music.]
We We we We need to talk! About us.
I've conquered so many worlds for the sake of the empire.
I do everything you ask, and I do it all perfectly.
But your very high standards put us all under a lot of pressure.
A Gem could crack under so much pressure.
We Diamonds may be hard, but we're also brittle.
White, we used to be close.
Don't you remember? When Pink would make us laugh All those silly things she
did for no reason.
There was a reason.
She wanted us to be happy together.
But we weren't, and we're still not.
I know my purpose isn't to be happy, but I find it harder and harder to enforce
your rules when they make me miserable.
When they make us all miserable.
White, please, why don't you let us all into your head? We could come up with a
plan to help everyone.
You could start by helping Yellow and Blue.

Your rockin' pal Sunstone is holdin' it down.
- Wow! - Holy - All right! - Unbelievable! - Oh, you better believe it.
- Okay! Sunstone, what are we gonna do? White Diamond's never going to listen
and she's never going to let us leave.
If she won't listen, we'll make her listen.
- And how are we gonna do that? - I know she's in there.
We'll bust into her head and change her mind.
ALL: Right! Let's take that bully down! But remember, kids: If you ever have to
deal with a bully, be sure to tell an adult.
Oh! Come on! Ally-oop! Kids, don't try this at home.
Ha! Bungakowa! Ah! Yeah! [Grunting.]
You can do it! Believe in yourself! Always.

Oh, no! Wah! Owwwwwww! Oof! - Agh! - Ahh! No dice.

- Then let's fuse.
All four of us.
It's the only way we're gonna get up to her head.

Then it's decided.
It's time to form Obsidian.

But, first, I made you a little somethin'.

Whoa-ah! [Crying out.]
Huh! [Smash!.]
[Clattering.]

[Ethereal, resonating tune plays.]
[music.]
[Resonating.]
White Diamond.
Oh, Starlight, what are you doing, crawling in here? You want your legs back?
You want your planet back? Surely, you can understand why I can't let you
leave.
Look what you did to yourself last time.
White Diamond, my name is Steven Universe.
I'm here to Aah! My, my.
We've been causing quite a scene, haven't we? What have you done to them?!
They're Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Poor Yellow.
Her impurities absorb all the blue in her light.
She's so strong but so weak, when it comes to Blue.
Ah, and Blue her impurities soak up all of the warmth in her spectrum.
She thinks she needs you, Pink.
As for me, I'm certain I don't need you.
After all, I'm every color of the light.
[wistfully.]
But you're a part of me.
The part I always have to repress.
What?! Dude, what is she even talking about? This is nonsense! [chortling.]
Oh.
Hello there.
Your new friends are so funny.
Is that what they're supposed to be, funny? [Sinister chord strikes.]
[Resonating.]
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [Gasping.]
Hey, White dirtwad! [pants.]
That all you got?! Huh? [Crackling, resonating.]
Oh, no! [Crying out.]
Leave her alone! [Resonating.]
Aggggggh! [Resonating.]
Arrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhh! Stop! [Resonating.]
Ah! Ahh! Ahh ahh ahhhh! Ahhhhh! White Diamond: It's a pity, the way you bring
out the worst in others.
See how you've encouraged their deficiencies? It's written all over their Gems:
insecure, dependent, obsessed.
[Thud.]
Oh, no, no.
Guys! Come on, snap out of it! [bitterly.]
Please stop helping them.
You'll only make things worse.
That's what you do.
I make things better.
Here [snaps fingers.]
Oh, thank you, White Diamond.
I feel excellent now.
[Suspenseful music.]
Oh, thank you.
How generous of you.
Thank you, White Diamond.
We feel so much better now.
I feel excellent.
There we are! I've removed their flaws.
Now, there is nothing to hinder my white light from sparkling through them.
I'd rather not spread my uninhibited self so thin, you know, but you've made it
absolutely necessary.
Now, the impurities you've encouraged in them are gone.
Now, they are brilliant! Now, they are perfect! Now they are me! [Resonating.]
You're wrong.
Please, just listen to me! My friends don't need to be fixed! They're fine the
way they are, flaws and all! There you go again.
Do you understand why you defend their flaws? I know why, Pink.
You like surrounding yourself with inferior Gems.
What?! You enable their terrible behavior, so you can be the best of the worst.
That's not true! And, even if it is even if it was, y-you're talking about my
mom.
You're not talking about me! [Cackles maliciously.]
Your "mom"? [Continues cackling.]
[Whoosh!.]
[Music.]
Guys, I'm here! Huh? Pearl? Connie! Well, what have we here? It's another one
of your pets.
[Vocalizing.]
Wait! Whoa! [Grunting.]
Huh? Aah! [music.]
[Sinister music.]
[Muffled protest.]
Let her go.
These worthless Gems weren't enough, were they? See how you surround yourself
with lower life forms? You've smothered yourself in them.
It feels good, doesn't it, Pink? Dulling your power, hiding your face, blaming
everything on someone else.
You became Rose Quartz to deceive your pathetic friends.
And, now, you've improved on that, because you're even deceiving yourself.
No.
You're wrong! I'm not my mom! But don't you know things about her that you
couldn't possibly know? I-I've just been connecting with her.
[music.]
My powers, they they help me connect to others.
[music.]
[Sinister music intensifies.]
I-I'm not her.
I'm just feeling her feelings.
[music.]
[Sinister chord strikes.]
Isn't it obvious? Even though you've embedded yourself in that human child,
your light can't help shining through.
You know you're in there.
You've known it all along.
Stop cowering inside your Gem.
You can hide from yourself, but you can't hide from me, Pink.
[Muffled protest.]
Don't listen to her, Steven! She's just trying to mess with you! [music.]
Steven! [Grunting.]
[music.]
Now, Starlight, [Grunting.]
this has gone on long enough.
[Gasping.]
[Suspenseful music climbs.]
[Clink.]
It's time to come out, Pink.
[Suspenseful music climbs.]
No-o-o-o-o! [music.]
Connie: [distantly.]
Steven.
Steven, please.
- [High-pitched tone whines.]
- [sobbing.]
Steven, wake up.
Look at me! Please.
[Tone continues whining.]
Steven? Steven! [Static crackling.]
What? No Where? Where Where's my ? [Resonating.]
[Ethereal tune plays.]
[Resonating.]
[music.]
[Voices whispering.]
[music.]
[music.]
[Low tone humming.]
[music.]
[Gasp.]
Anh! [Thud.]
Steven! No [sobbing.]
Please, I I need I need What is this? Where is Pink? She's gone.
What did you say? Answer me! She's go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne! [Growling echo fades.]
[Tone buzzes, stops.]
[Crying out.]
[Bright flourish plays.]
[Suspenseful music.]
Where do you think you're going? [music.]
- Help - Steven! [Grunting.]
Hold on! [music.]
Don't you dare take one more step! [echoing.]
One more step! That's enough! [Resonating.]
Ahhh, you little [Zap!.]
[Resonating.]
[Resonating.]
Agh! Don't you raise your shield at me! I only want you to be yourself! If you
can't do that, I'll do it for you! [Resonating.]
[warbling.]
[music.]
Aaaah! [Thudding.]
[crying.]
No, stop.
You're hurting them! [Thud.]
Ahh! Ahh! [pants.]
[Suspenseful music.]
[Panting.]
Here.
[music.]
[Laughing warmly.]
[Both laughing.]
What are you doing? Pink! Why are you laughing? [Laughter.]
[Ethereal tune plays plays.]
[Laughter.]
[music.]
[music.]
Steven! Oh! Are you back together? Are you you? Yeah! Yeah, I'm me! I've always
been me No! You are Pink Diamond! That is Pink Diamond's gem! You do not look
like this! You do not sound like this! You are not half human, you're just
acting like a child! I am a child.
What's your excuse? [Laughs.]
[music.]
[music.]
What's happening? What is this? What's wrong with them? They're turning pink! I
don't understand I'm in control, I [Gasps.]
Something's wrong with me! No! [music.]
Both: Guys! Steven Are you okay?! Uh, what happened? I think Steven got through
to her! Aah! - Aah! - Ha! Listen up, you nail heads! The Crystal Gems are here
to huh? [Laughter.]
Steven! [Laughter.]
Are you okay? Are you hurt? Oh, look at White.
She's shakin' like a piece of chalk! Wh-What happened Where am I? Welcome back.
What is this?! I feel ridiculous.
Yellow, Blue! [Gasps.]
She's off-color.
This can't be happening! I can't have a flaw! I'm supposed to be flawless! If
I'm not perfect, then who am I?! If you're not Pink, then who are you?! Who Who
is anyone?! Ya know, if you just let everyone be whoever they are, maybe you
could let yourself be whoever you are, too.
But I'm not supposed to be like this! I'm supposed to know better! I'm supposed
to be better! I'm supposed to make everything better! You can! But first,
you're going to have to leave your own head.
[music.]
Sadie: And if we look at a place Well, baby, that's okay I'll drive us into
outer space Where we can't hear what people say I know I don't have a plan I'm
workin' on that part At least I've got a van So let me drive my van into your

Lars: Welcome home, guys.

Lars? It's really you! Sadie?! There she is! It's her! We're about to see Sadie

Well - [Laughs.]
I think it suits us! Yeah.
